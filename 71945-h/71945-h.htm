<p class="ph2">FRANK MERRIWELL’S BROTHER.</p>

<hr class="tiny">
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.<br>

<small>A WARM RECEPTION.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When Frank Merriwell, in a great hurry, flung open
the door of his room and sprang in, he was little prepared
for the reception that followed.</p>

<p>From all sides they leaped upon him, clutched him,
surrounded him, hemmed him in. There were exactly
thirteen of them, and he was alone and unarmed.</p>

<p>Never before had Merriwell quailed in the face of
odds, but now he took one look at them and then flung
up his hands, crying:</p>

<p>“I surrender!”</p>

<p>They clutched those uplifted hands and dragged
them down. They grasped him about the body, around
the neck, anywhere, everywhere. Howls of joy arose.</p>

<p>“We’ve got you!” they yelled.</p>

<p>Then they wrenched at his hands, one after another,
as if trying to tear his arms from their sockets. Then
they thumped him on the back, the shoulders, and the
chest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>On the outskirts of the attacking mob one wild-eyed
fellow fought like a demon to get at Merry.</p>

<p>“Got my vay oud of!” he roared, as he butted into
the mob. “Break away! Let me got ad him!”</p>

<p>“Git aout!” cried another, a tall, lank chap, as he
put his foot against the fat stomach of the one who
was fighting to reach Merry. “Go lay daown, gol ding
ye!”</p>

<p>“Give me a cloob!” roared one with a strong brogue
of the Ould Sod. “It’s mesilf that’ll be afther makin’
a way here!”</p>

<p>Then he wedged his shoulder into the crowd and
flung the others aside till he could get in and grasp
Merry’s hand.</p>

<p>“Ye spalpane!” he shouted. “It’s a soight fer sore
oies ye are! Begorra, Oi’m ready to die wid joy!”</p>

<p>“Barney Mulloy!” laughed Frank, as he wrung the
hand of the honest Irish youth. “I’m delighted!”</p>

<p>“Let me git in there!” rasped the tall, lank fellow.
“If ye don’t make way fer me, I’ll bet a darn good
squash somebody gits bumped!”</p>

<p>Then he succeeded in getting hold of Merry’s free
hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, say!” he cried; “I’m jest reddy to lay right
daown and die frum satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“Ephraim Gallup!” burst from Merry.</p>

<p>“Right off the farm, b’gosh!” chuckled Ephraim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“Vy don’t you both gone und died alretty!”
squawked the one who had been kicked, as he came
charging in and drove against Mulloy and Gallup.
“Id vould peen a goot thing der coundry vor. Yaw!
I vandt to shook Vrank Merrivell by my handt! Got
avay!”</p>

<p>“And Hans Dunnerwurst!” exclaimed Merriwell, as
he grasped the outstretched, pudgy hand of the fat
young Dutchman.</p>

<p>“Dot vos me,” nodded Hans, in delight. “How you
peen, Vrankie, ain’t id? You vos glatness to seen me.
Yaw!”</p>

<p>“You fellows give me that fired teeling—I mean
that tired feeling!” declared a handsome, curly-haired
youth, as he thrust Mulloy, Gallup, and Dunnerwurst
aside. “Why don’t you let somebody else have a show?
I want to fake his shin—I mean shake his fin!”</p>

<p>“It’s Harry Rattleton!” Frank ejaculated, as he returned
the hearty hand-grip of the curly-haired youth.
“Dear old Harry!”</p>

<p>There were tears in Rattleton’s eyes, and his honest
face showed the deep emotion he felt and tried to
hide.</p>

<p>Fighting, squealing, kicking at each other, two little
fellows now plunged against Rattleton. One was red-headed
and freckle-faced, while the other had a snub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
nose and a cherublike face. But they seemed trying
to scratch out each other’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Me first!” yelled the cherub.</p>

<p>“I guess nit!” shrieked the one with freckles.</p>

<p>“Here! here! that will do!” smiled Merry, as he
grasped them and pulled them apart. “It seems to me
you chaps are old enough to quit fighting like kids.”</p>

<p>Then they both turned and seized his hands, which
they wrung with all the strength at their command,
yelling:</p>

<p>“How are you, Merry? We’re glad you see us!”</p>

<p>“The same Stubbs and the same Griswold,” nodded
Frank.</p>

<p>“The same Merriwell!” they returned, in unison.
“Only more famous!”</p>

<p>“I reckon it’s my turn to shake Mr. Merriwell’s
paw,” said a strong, hearty voice, as a big, broad-shouldered
youth put Bink and Danny aside. “That’s
whatever!”</p>

<p>“Badger, too!” Frank cried, as his hand met that of
the Westerner. “This is untold pleasure!”</p>

<p>“You bet it is!” nodded Buck.</p>

<p>“I trust you’ll not overlook me, Merriwell,” said a
pleasant, soft, well-modulated voice, as a handsome,
fine-faced youth stepped in, with an agreeable smile
and a white hand outheld.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“Jack Diamond, by all that’s good!” Merriwell
gasped, as he took that hand. “Back from Europe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Merriwell; back in time to see you win your
final honors.”</p>

<p>The handsome Virginian looked handsomer than
ever.</p>

<p>Greg Carker, Bert Dashleigh, Jim Hooker, Ralph
Bingham, and Oll Packard were the others who had
crowded about Merry when he entered the room, and
they were filled with great joy because of his pleasure
in meeting those old friends of other days.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to have us arrested for breaking and
entering, Merry,” said Carker. “I knew these fellows
were going to be here, and we planned this little surprise.
I swiped your duplicate door-key so that I could
admit them to this room.”</p>

<p>“I’ll forgive you, Carker, if you do not let the earthquake
rumble.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Greg, “that I’ll keep the earthquake
suppressed till commencement is over.”</p>

<p>“Do,” urged Frank.</p>

<p>Oliver Packard did not have much to say. He had
been accepted as one of Merry’s friends, for all of his
vicious brother, Roland, the twin who looked—or had
looked in the past—exactly like him. Oliver had all
the fine instincts of a gentleman, and the conduct of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Roland had worn upon him and given him lines of
care. It was now known among the students that,
since his final defeat by Merriwell, Roland was fast
becoming an inebriate, and it was said that he would
not be able to finish his medical course. Of course, this
worried Oliver, but he tried to hide his own troubles.</p>

<p>Hooker, once an outcast, was another who had received
a warm hand-grasp from Merriwell and had
felt in his heart that he was most fortunate to be
there.</p>

<p>Ralph Bingham, the big sophomore, had taken part
in the struggle, his heart throbbing with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“There are others coming,” he now declared. “All
the rest of the flock will be here right away.”</p>

<p>“You mean——”</p>

<p>“Hodge, Ready, Gamp, Browning, and the others.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Badger, “I reckon we’d better
bring forward the reserves at once.”</p>

<p>“The reserves?” said Merry.</p>

<p>“Yes. Ladies.”</p>

<p>Buck flung back a portière, and then out flitted four
beautiful girls, who had been waiting for that moment.</p>

<p>Elsie was there, laughing with joy, her sweet face
flushed, her blue eyes like the depths of a lake-mirrored
sky. The girl with Elsie put her forward, and it was
Elsie who murmured in Merry’s ear:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“Frank, we’re all so happy and so proud of you!
Inza is the happiest and proudest!”</p>

<p>“Inza!” exclaimed Frank, in great surprise, for he
had not dreamed of seeing her there, for she was in
mourning for her father.</p>

<p>“Frank!”</p>

<p>He looked deep into her dark eyes, which gazed
upon him in loving pride.</p>

<p>“This,” he said, restraining himself and steadying
his voice, “is a pleasure that was entirely unexpected.”</p>

<p>He gave Elsie his other hand.</p>

<p>“We rather reckoned you’d be pleased,” said Badger.
“But I don’t want you to forget that the former Miss
Lee is now Mrs. Badger, and I’ll not permit you to
look at her the way you’re looking at those young
ladies.”</p>

<p>Frank flushed and laughed, turning to the handsome,
brown-eyed girl at the side of the Westerner.</p>

<p>“Miss Lee—no, Mrs. Badger,” he said, “I am delighted
to see you again.”</p>

<p>Winnie gave him her hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind Buck,” she said. “He’s jealous of
everybody. He’d be jealous of an Indian.”</p>

<p>“That’s whatever,” confessed the Kansan. “I allow
I’m built that way, and I can’t help it. I know I make
an onery fool of myself sometimes, but Mrs. Badger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
has a nice little way of forgiving me. I rather think
she likes it, to tell the truth.”</p>

<p>Diamond touched Frank’s arm. There was a look
of deep pride on his face, mingled with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“Permit me,” he said.</p>

<p>Merry turned.</p>

<p>“My wife, Mr. Merriwell,” said the Southerner.</p>

<p>A handsome, dark-eyed girl, somewhat resembling
Inza, stood there.</p>

<p>“Your—your wife?” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p>The girl was the sister of Dolph Reynolds, whom he
had met in London.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Jack. “We didn’t invite you to the
wedding, as it took place rather suddenly on the other
side of the pond. I hope you’ll pardon us for the
failure to notify you, but we decided to do so in person.”</p>

<p>“Diamond,” said Frank heartily, as he grasped the
hand of his college comrade, “I offer you my most
sincere congratulations. I think you are a lucky
dog.”</p>

<p>The English girl was blushing and laughing.</p>

<p>“You do not congratulate me,” she said. “And you
know I had to make an explanation before he would
come back to me after he became jealous of my
cousin.”</p>

<p>“I’ll reserve my congratulations,” said Merry smilingly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
“till I find that he has made you a good husband.”</p>

<p>“Merriwell, I think that right mean of you!” Diamond
exclaimed, somewhat nettled. “Your words and
manner are calculated to arouse distrust and suspicion
in her mind. Do you think that quite fair?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” confessed Frank, seeing how seriously
Jack took it. “Far be it from me to arouse
anything of the sort by words spoken in jest.”</p>

<p>The Virginian breathed easier.</p>

<p>“Now we’re so nicely introduced all round, let’s try
to be real jappy and holly—I mean happy and jolly,”
said Harry Rattleton. “Hasn’t any girl married me
yet?”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Bink Stubbs, “that idiocy among the
female sex is decreasing.”</p>

<p>“There are ladies present,” said Harry severely, as
he glared at Bink. “Thus you are saved for the time.”</p>

<p>“Here!” cried Griswold, taking down a gilded horseshoe
from the wall and offering it to the other little
chap. “Take it. You’re dead in luck.”</p>

<p>Stubbs regarded the horseshoe doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Do you regard horseshoes as lucky?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Bink, “the horse I bet on the last time
was running barefooted. Cluck, cluck; git ap!”</p>

<p>“Bah!” retorted Danny. “A clean swipe out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
comic column of some paper. Say, who’s your favorite
writer, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“My father.”</p>

<p>“Your father?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What did he ever write?”</p>

<p>“Checks.”</p>

<p>“They’re off!” exclaimed Rattleton. “You can’t
stop them.”</p>

<p>“You know you can always stop a river by damming
it,” grinned Bink.</p>

<p>“But you can’t stop an alarm-clock that way,”
chipped in Danny.</p>

<p>“That will do!” said Frank severely, although he
was laughing inwardly. “This occasion is not suited
for such stale jokes.”</p>

<p>“Stale!” said Danny.</p>

<p>“Stale!” echoed Bink.</p>

<p>“And they are the very best in our repertoire,” declared
the little red-headed chap.</p>

<p>“Then your repertoire needs replenishing,” said
Merry.</p>

<p>So the little jokers were repressed for the time, although
they were sure to break out again and again
at the slightest provocation, or without any provocation.</p>

<p>“What makes us feel real bad,” said Diamond, “is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
that we were unable to get along soon enough to witness
the great ball-game to-day between Yale and Harvard.
I felt sure Yale would win.”</p>

<p>“Merriwell won the game himself,” declared Oliver
Packard, who had once played on the nine, but whose
standing as an athlete and whose chance to take part
in athletic sports had been ruined by the actions of his
brother. “It was the greatest work I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Right!” agreed Carker, the socialist, also a ballplayer
of no mean caliber. “The manner in which he
stopped Harvard from scoring near the end of the
game was enough to set every Yale man wild with admiration.
It was great!”</p>

<p>“Great!” nodded Jim Hooker.</p>

<p>“Magnificent!” laughed Bert Dashleigh.</p>

<p>“Hot stuff!” nodded Ralph Bingham.</p>

<p>Rattleton, Stubbs, Griswold, Gallup, Dunnerwurst,
and Mulloy had reached the field after the game began,
but in the vast throng they had been unobserved by
Merry. All were profuse in their compliments for
Frank, but he cut them short.</p>

<p>“Every man on the nine played as if his life depended
on the result,” he declared. “They deserve just
as much credit as I do.”</p>

<p>But not one who had seen the game would agree to
that.</p>

<p>While they were talking, the door opened, and Bart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Hodge entered, followed by Browning, Ready, Mason,
Carson, Morgan, Starbright, Gamp, and Benson.</p>

<p>The principal members of the varsity nine, the ones
who had been mainly responsible for the winning of
the championship, had come to that room to gather
round their captain for the last time before the parting
that might break their ranks forever.</p>

<p>Of course, they were surprised, and, of course, there
was more hand-shaking and introducing of Mrs. Diamond.
The Virginian was showered with congratulations.</p>

<p>Jack Ready stood and looked at Juliet with an expression
of regretful sadness on his face.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad!” he finally sighed.</p>

<p>“What’s too bad, Mr. Ready?” she asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>“That we did not meet before this hot-headed young
man from the warm and reckless South drifted across
your horizon. Alas, you are no longer a lass! It is
too late, too late!”</p>

<p>He seemed to heave a great sob from the depths of
his bosom.</p>

<p>“Sir!” exclaimed Diamond, “what do you mean?
Are you seeking to insult me?”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, my dear old college chum,” said Ready,
who really took extreme delight in irritating Diamond.
“Far be it from me to indulge in such rudeness. Still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
I cannot help thinking that you would not have stood
a ghost of a show had I happened along in advance of
you. I would have dawned on her delighted vision
like a ten-thousand-dollar diamond sunburst, while you
would have resembled a two-dollar rhinestone cluster.
I have no desire to cause you misery, so I shall take
care not to let her see much of me, well knowing it will
lead her in time to regret her choice of a side-partner
if she often beholds my intellectual countenance and
fascinating figure.”</p>

<p>Juliet bit her lip and suppressed a laugh, but Diamond,
knowing Ready was guying him, felt like hitting
him.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing for you,” whispered the Southerner,
“that the ladies are here.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“If they were not, I’d give you a black eye!”</p>

<p>“Go ’way!” said Ready. “I think you’re horrid!”</p>

<p>Frank’s rooms were crowded now, and a chatter of
conversation arose. Of course, Merry was the center
of interest, but he found an opportunity to draw
back and look around. These were the loyal friends
he had made—the dear friends of his school and college
days. They had clung to him through thick and
thin, and he felt his heart swelling with affection toward
them all. Even Dade Morgan was included, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Morgan had tried his best in these final college days
to prove that he was repentant for the past and ready
to do anything in his power to make atonement.</p>

<p>Memories of old times came rushing upon Frank in
that moment. He thought of his first meeting with
Hodge at Fardale, and of the adventures, struggles,
and triumphs that followed. He thought of his coming
to Yale, of his freshman struggles, of the enemies
who seemed to rise around him as he toiled upward
and onward, of the friends who were here and who
had remained firm in every change that befell him.</p>

<p>Oh, those grand days of toil and pleasure at Yale!
He felt that he would give much to live them all over
again. But the end had come, and now he was going
out into the world—going to bid Yale farewell!</p>

<p>This thought brought him a feeling of unspeakable
sadness. It seemed that he was leaving the only home
he knew. Home—yes, it was home for him. In truth,
he had no other. Life lay before him, and he was to
set his course toward a high goal when he received his
sheepskin and turned his back on his alma mater. But
he felt that he was being parted from the happiest
portion of his life.</p>

<p>Then his eyes fell on the girls. Bart had found Elsie
and was talking to her, his dark face flushed, his eyes
glowing. She smiled and nodded as he was speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“They are happy,” said Frank, to himself.</p>

<p>He did not know that at that moment Hodge was
praising him to the skies, telling what a remarkable
game he had played and how he had covered himself
with glory in the battle against Harvard. He did not
know that somehow such praise was the pleasantest
thing Elsie Bellwood could hear.</p>

<p>He saw Inza, and she looked toward him. She
smiled, and he felt his heart throb.</p>

<p>Home! Yes, Yale had been his home; but now before
his vision there seemed to rise the picture of another
home and he hastened to Inza’s side.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br>

<small>ANTON MESCAL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>A dark-faced, Spanish-appearing man stopped
Roland Packard on the steps of the Tontine Hotel.</p>

<p>“Get out of the way!” snarled Roland, who had been
drinking.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said the man, in a soft, not unpleasant
voice. “I wish to speak to you. It is important.”</p>

<p>Roland was in anything but a pleasant mood. He
had seen Frank Merriwell cover himself with glory
in the game against Harvard, and, having foolishly
bet that the Cambridge men would win the championship,
he had taken to drink immediately after the
game.</p>

<p>“It’s got to be cursed important!” he snapped, looking
the stranger over. “I don’t know you. What’s
your name?”</p>

<p>“Anton Mescal.”</p>

<p>“Never heard it before. Are you one of these
blooming old grads who are overrunning the town?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then what in blazes——”</p>

<p>A group of men came out of the hotel and descended
the steps. They had gray hair about their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
temples, and some of them were bald beneath their
hats. They carried canes, their faces were flushed,
and they looked hilariously happy. They were a group
of “old grads,” and they had been celebrating Yale’s
victory. With them the celebration had just begun;
it would extend all through the night. As they rolled
down the steps, clinging to one another’s arms, they
were talking excitedly:</p>

<p>“He’s the greatest pitcher Yale ever produced!” asserted
one.</p>

<p>“Come off, Smithy, old man!” cried another. “You
know the class of ’Umpty-six had the champ. This fellow——”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk, Sluthers!” interrupted another. “Baseball
was different then. Whoever heard of curves?
This Merriwell——”</p>

<p>“Is a marvel!”</p>

<p>“He’s a dandy!”</p>

<p>“’Rah for Merriwell!”</p>

<p>“Let’s all cheer! Yow! I feel just like cheering!
Cheer for Merriwell!”</p>

<p>Then they bumped against Roland Packard, who
snarled at them. One of them grasped him; others
followed the example of that one. They bore him
down the steps to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” the grad who had
grasped him first demanded. “Are you a sorehead?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Well, by thunder, I want to hear you cheer for Merriwell!”</p>

<p>“You’ll want a long time!” declared Roland, savagely.
“Let go of my collar!”</p>

<p>“Boys,” said the old fellow fiercely, “here’s a chap
who won’t cheer for Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“Shoot him!” advised another, who was rather unsteady
on his feet. “Don’t bother with him! Shoot
him on the spot, Bilton!”</p>

<p>“What spot?” asked Bilton.</p>

<p>“Any old spot.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the one who had Roland by the
collar, “I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>He was just intoxicated enough to be reckless, and
he actually took a revolver out of his hip pocket.</p>

<p>“Brought this to celebrate with,” he declared.
“Loaded it for that purpose; but I guess I’ll shoot this
fellow.”</p>

<p>Then he fired straight at Roland’s breast.</p>

<p>Packard fell back with a gasping cry, and the dark-faced
man caught him. The other old grads were appalled
by the act of their companion, who himself
was rather dazed, not having intended to fire the revolver;
but he quickly recovered, saying:</p>

<p>“He isn’t hurt, gentlemen! The danged thing is
loaded with blanks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>Packard threatened to call for the police, not one of
whom happened to be near.</p>

<p>Not wishing to get into trouble on account of the
reckless act of their companion, the old grads hastened
away.</p>

<p>Anton Mescal, the man with the dark face, laughed
a little, as he said:</p>

<p>“Is this the East? Why, I didn’t suppose men were
so careless with their guns here. For a moment I
fancied I must be at home.”</p>

<p>Packard swore.</p>

<p>“Infernal old fools!” he muttered. “I’m going to
follow and have them arrested! I’ll put that drunken
idiot in the jug for this! Why, he would have shot
me dead if the thing had been loaded with a ball cartridge!”</p>

<p>“Better let them go,” urged Mescal. “I want to
talk with you about something important.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t know you.”</p>

<p>“I introduced myself just before those men attempted
to stampede us.”</p>

<p>Packard seemed in doubt. He wanted to follow and
make trouble for the man who had been so reckless
with his revolver, and yet something was urging him
to listen to the stranger, who claimed to have important
business with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“If we stay here,” he said, “we’ll get bumped into
again by these gray-haired Yale men of other days.”</p>

<p>“Yet I must stay here. Let’s get off the steps, where
we can watch both entrances. I am not going to be
given the slip again.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Something I will explain if you prove to be the man
I think you are.”</p>

<p>“You are from the West?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, partner. Come down here.”</p>

<p>They moved aside on the walk, where they took
pains to avoid the groups of hilarious men who were
circulating in that vicinity.</p>

<p>“You do not like Merriwell,” said the man who
called himself Mescal. “You refused to cheer for
him, even when that man drew a gun on you.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t suppose the howling chump was crazy
enough to shoot.”</p>

<p>“Still you refused to cheer for Merriwell, and
everybody else is howling for him.”</p>

<p>“What of that?” asked Packard suspiciously.
“Haven’t I got a right to refuse?”</p>

<p>“Of course. The very fact that you did refuse convinced
me that I had made no mistake in my man. You
dislike Merriwell, when everybody else seems wild
about him. You seem to be his only enemy here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“That’s right. There were enough of them once,
but I’m the only one left.”</p>

<p>“What has become of them all?”</p>

<p>“He has triumphed over them, and they have bowed
down to worship him. They are howling themselves
hoarse over him to-night.”</p>

<p>“You mean——”</p>

<p>“They have become his friends, or else they have
been driven out of college.”</p>

<p>“How does it happen that you have not succumbed?”</p>

<p>“Because I will not!” panted Roland fiercely.</p>

<p>“He has never defeated you?”</p>

<p>Packard hesitated about answering, for he knew
that in everything that had brought about a contest
between himself and Merriwell the latter had
been victorious.</p>

<p>“Only temporarily,” he asserted. “I never give up.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Mescal. “I am more than ever
satisfied that you are the very man I want.”</p>

<p>Packard now demanded a full explanation. His
curiosity had been awakened. Still Mescal, the soft-spoken
man from the West, was rather cautious.</p>

<p>“Would you like to strike Merriwell a last blow?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Would I?” said the medic. “Ask me!”</p>

<p>For a moment the Westerner knitted his brows.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
He had asked Packard, and the slang of the East
bothered him. But the expression on Packard’s face
demonstrated his meaning, and Anton Mescal nodded.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” he said. “I may be able to give
you the opportunity.”</p>

<p>“But you have not explained,” insisted Roland.</p>

<p>“I will. It takes a little time.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s go in here and get a drink. I’m dry
and tired.”</p>

<p>Mescal shook his head, grasping the student by the
arm.</p>

<p>“Stay here,” he directed. “It is necessary if you
wish to strike Merriwell.”</p>

<p>This surprised Roland.</p>

<p>“What are you coming at?” he growled. “Think
I’m going to hit him with my fist?”</p>

<p>“No. I am watching for a man who is in that
hotel. I must not miss that man when he comes
out.”</p>

<p>“How is he connected?”</p>

<p>“I have followed him pretty nearly three thousand
miles, trying to watch him night and day. Four times
he has given me the slip, and four times I have picked
up his trail again. I have tried in every possible way
to accomplish my purpose before he could reach this
place, but thus far I have failed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>This was interesting, and yet Packard failed to see
how it was related to Merriwell.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain,” said the Westerner. “This man is
the bearer of an important message to Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t stop him now unless you kidnap
or kill him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to stop him.”</p>

<p>“What, then?”</p>

<p>“I want to get hold of that message.”</p>

<p>“You wish to know what it is?”</p>

<p>“I know now.”</p>

<p>“Hey? Then why do you wish to get hold of it?
Why the dickens have you put yourself to so much
trouble?”</p>

<p>“Because I do not wish it to reach the hands of
Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“The bearer——”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t the least idea what the message is.”</p>

<p>“Oh-ho!”</p>

<p>“He is simply a messenger—nothing more. He
has been instructed to deliver an oilskin envelope
to Merriwell. He knows absolutely nothing of the
contents of that envelope. If he were to lose it, he
would fail utterly in his task.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>Packard nodded, and made a motion for the man
to go on.</p>

<p>“This message,” said Mescal, “is of the utmost importance
to Merriwell. It will do him great damage
not to receive it. Get it and place it in my hands, and
you will strike Merriwell a terrible blow. Besides
that, I will give you five hundred dollars in cold
cash.”</p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars?” gasped Packard doubtingly.</p>

<p>“Just that. I mean it, and here is the money, to
convince you that I can keep my word.”</p>

<p>The Westerner displayed a roll of bills, the outside
one being for the amount of five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Now, Roland Packard was involved in debt, and
knew not how to clear himself. Of a sudden, he
fancied he saw a way to wipe out his debts and strike
a blow at Merriwell at the same time, and his bloodshot
eyes shone greedily.</p>

<p>“How am I to do this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That is for you to settle.”</p>

<p>“You mean that——”</p>

<p>“That you are to find a way. I am at the end of
my resources, else I would not have applied to you. It
was by chance that I heard you spoken of as the only
enemy of Merriwell remaining in Yale, and it was by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
chance—a lucky one—that you happened along and
were pointed out. I lost no time in stopping you right
here, hoping you might be the man to do this work.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it if possible; but how is it to be done?”</p>

<p>“Again I say that is something for you to find out.
I will point out to you the man who has the message,
and you are to follow him and get it if you
can. If you succeed, the money is yours the moment
you place that oilskin envelope in my hands.
Are you ready to try it?”</p>

<p>“You bet! When——”</p>

<p>“Now!” whispered Mescal, as he stepped behind
Packard, so that the student was between him and
a man who was descending the steps of the Tontine.
“There goes the man with the message!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br>

<small>THE MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The man with the message was smooth-faced and
shrewd-appearing. He stepped out from the Tontine
briskly. He was dressed in a plain gray suit of
clothes.</p>

<p>“After him!” whispered Mescal. “He has the message!
Get it somehow—anyhow! Get it before Merriwell
reads it!”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best,” promised Packard. “Where’ll
I find you?”</p>

<p>“Here—at this hotel.”</p>

<p>Without another word, Roland Packard started
after the man in gray. Up Chapel Street went the
man, with Roland not far behind.</p>

<p>The student was trying to think of some way to secure
the message. He was desperate, and desperate
schemes flitted through his brain. He thought of attacking
the man on the street and trying to go through
his pockets; but New Haven was thronged with visitors,
old and young, and Packard found no opportunity,
knowing full well that all chances of success
were against him. Desperate though he was, he
had no relish for arrest on the charge of assault and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
robbery. But Roland’s eyes were open, and he was
on the watch for an opportunity. Still, something told
him that the man was going directly to Merriwell, and
he felt that his show of accomplishing his purpose was
becoming smaller with every step.</p>

<p>Already preparations were being made for a hilarious
time in the vicinity of Osborne Hall that night.
Packard knew there would be speeches, cheering, red
fire, and all that, but he gave it no thought now.</p>

<p>“All New Haven has gone daffy over Merriwell!”
he muttered to himself, as he heard Frank’s name
spoken many times by passing men. “Anybody would
think there was nothing else to talk of! Merriwell
eclipses class day, senior prom, graduation, everything.
Oh, if I could get a last crack at him right in the
height of his glory! And to make five hundred plunks
at the same time. I must do it somehow!”</p>

<p>But how?—that was the question. He ground his
teeth as he saw his chances diminishing. The campus
was reached, and the man in gray made directly for
Vanderbilt.</p>

<p>“Going straight to Merriwell’s room!” thought Roland.
“Perhaps I’ll have a chance on the stairs.”</p>

<p>No one paid much attention to Packard. Everybody
seemed hilariously happy. He was close behind
the bearer of the message when that individual entered
Vanderbilt; but the opportunity did not come. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
seemed that a perfect stream of men was making for
Merriwell’s room or coming from it.</p>

<p>“Just pouring congratulations on him,” said the
medic. “Oh, he’s the king-pin here!”</p>

<p>He saw the messenger reach the door of Frank’s
room, which was standing wide open. Within that
room there seemed to be a mass of happy students.</p>

<p>“No use!” grated Packard. “I didn’t get a chance!”</p>

<p>Just then Oliver Packard and Hock Mason came
out and descended the stairs. Neither of them observed
Roland.</p>

<p>“He has been there,” muttered Merry’s enemy, looking
after his twin brother, whom he so closely resembled
in outward appearance, although otherwise
there was not the slightest similarity.</p>

<p>Then a sudden thought came to him. In the past
he had been mistaken for Oliver a score of times, and
again he might perpetrate the deception. No one
would expect him to boldly enter Merriwell’s room.
If any one had observed the departure of Oliver, it
might be fancied that Oliver had returned, if Roland
were seen.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” he muttered, and he boldly followed
the messenger into the room.</p>

<p>He saw Frank in the midst of his friends. He would
have given ten years of his life to win such homage
from that admiring throng. Yet he could not help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
seeing that Frank Merriwell bore himself with perfect
modesty, as if feeling himself no better than his humblest
friend. Merry’s position was most difficult, and
only a man of remarkable tact could have filled it
without seeming to pose. It was this atmosphere maintained
by Frank at all times that had made him so
popular. He did not betray exaltation, and yet in no
way did he lower himself by his quiet, unaffected manners.</p>

<p>The man in gray slowly pushed forward till he
could touch Frank’s arm. In a moment when Merry
was not engaged, the stranger spoke, saying:</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell, I beg your pardon for bothering
you now, but my business is most important. I will
trouble you only a minute, if you will kindly step
aside.”</p>

<p>Frank was surprised, but his courtesy was sufficient
to enable him to betray it only by a slight lifting
of the eyebrows. Then he excused himself to those
immediately about him and stepped apart with the
man.</p>

<p>“I would not have bothered you now,” said the
stranger, “but I am the bearer of an important message
to you, and I wish to get it out of my hands
without delay, as there is danger that I may lose it.
I shall not feel easy till I have turned it over to you,
when my task will be completed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“A message?” said Frank. “From whom?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. I know nothing, save that I have
been paid a large sum of money to bring it to you, and
to guard it with my life till it is in your hands.”</p>

<p>Such a statement as this was calculated to arouse
interest.</p>

<p>“And you do not know whom the message is
from?”</p>

<p>“I do not. It was not my place to make inquiries.
All I know is that I have been pursued from Colorado
to this city by a man who has seemed determined to
rob me of it.”</p>

<p>This added to the interest.</p>

<p>“But he did not succeed?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I am here, and I have the message, which
I will now hand over to you.”</p>

<p>From an inner pocket the man took an oilskin envelope,
which he gave to Frank, who looked at it
curiously. On the envelope were traced these words:</p>

<p>“To Frank Harrison Merriwell; not to be opened
until the day after he graduates from Yale.”</p>

<p>The moment Frank saw that writing, which was
wavering and unsteady, he uttered a little exclamation,
his face paling.</p>

<p>“It’s from my father!” he murmured. “I wonder
what it can be!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>The messenger now presented a receipt for Frank
to sign, having produced a fountain pen.</p>

<p>Merry signed the receipt, although for some reason
which he himself did not fully understand his
hand was not as steady as usual.</p>

<p>“There,” said the man, “I thank goodness that my
task is accomplished!”</p>

<p>“Who gave you this?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“My chief.”</p>

<p>“Your chief? You mean——”</p>

<p>“I am in the employ of the Great Western Detective
Agency, of Denver, and my chief placed this
in my hands. He stated that I was to receive two
thousand dollars if I delivered it into your hands.
He had been asked to name a man who was reliable,
and I was chosen. The man who sent the message
fixed the remuneration I was to receive. What he
paid the chief I do not know.”</p>

<p>Strange thoughts ran riot in Frank’s brain. He
had not heard from his father for some time, and he
had not seen Mr. Merriwell since they parted in
Florida. The last letter had assured Frank that his father
was safe and comfortable, and, knowing the peculiarities
of the man, he had not worried much for
all of the period of silence. But now something told
Merry that strange things were soon to happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“You have performed your duty well,” said Merry,
as he returned the pen to the man in gray.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the stranger quietly. “And now
I will bid you good-by.”</p>

<p>Then he quietly departed, leaving the mysterious
message, and Frank stood there studying the oilskin
envelope, wondering what it contained. For the time
he forgot his surroundings, forgot the friends who
were present, forgot the triumphs of the day, and gave
himself up to vain speculation.</p>

<p>His father was a most mysterious man, seldom
doing anything in a conventional manner. Yet somehow
it seemed to Merry that this did not account for
the care and expense to which Mr. Merriwell had gone
in order to have the message safely delivered into the
hands of his son.</p>

<p>Of course Frank had no thought of opening that
envelope before the time set—the day after graduation.
He wondered if it could be that the envelope
contained a check for a large sum of money which he
was to use in starting out in a business career. Anyhow,
it was certain, Merry thought, that the contents
must be valuable.</p>

<p>He was not aware of a pair of greedy eyes fastened
upon him. He was not aware of a person who moved
cautiously toward him without attracting attention.</p>

<p>Roland Packard was desperate. The message had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
been delivered, but as yet Merriwell knew nothing of
its import. Packard reasoned that this was his last
chance to earn that alluring five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Reaching a favorable position, Roland glanced
round toward the door, observing that, for the present,
the coast was clear.</p>

<p>Then he turned, and, like a flash, his hand went out,
his fingers closing on the envelope, which was snatched
from Merriwell’s grasp.</p>

<p>Without a word, without a sound, the desperate
student leaped toward the door.</p>

<p>Merry, who had thought himself surrounded by
friends, who to the last man were constant and true,
had been taken utterly by surprise, but he quickly recovered.</p>

<p>“Stop, Packard!”</p>

<p>With that cry, he sprang after Roland, who was
vanishing through the door. In a moment there was
great excitement in the room.</p>

<p>Hans Dunnerwurst had seen the envelope snatched
from Merry’s fingers, and he tried to overtake Roland,
shouting:</p>

<p>“Come away back mit dot! Id dit nod belonging
to you!”</p>

<p>In his rush for the door he collided with Ephraim
Gallup, who likewise had leaped after the thief, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
they went down heavily in the doorway, locked fast
in each other’s arms.</p>

<p>“Gol ding a fool!” spluttered the youth from Vermont.</p>

<p>Merry was compelled to leap over them both, which
he did, dashing out after Packard. Half-way down
the stairs Frank clutched Oliver, who was calmly returning
to Merry’s room.</p>

<p>“Give it up!” commanded Merry sternly.</p>

<p>Oliver was astounded.</p>

<p>“Give what up?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The message.”</p>

<p>“What message?”</p>

<p>“You know. This is no time for joking, and it is
a very poor joke, at best.”</p>

<p>“Joke?” said Oliver wonderingly. “What are you
talking about, Merriwell? I know nothing of any
joke.”</p>

<p>Frank held him off and looked at him sternly.
Merry’s friends were swarming to the head of the
stairs.</p>

<p>“Frank’s got him!” they cried.</p>

<p>“Yaw!” shouted Hans Dunnerwurst. “Dot vos der
lobsder vot didded id! Holdt him onto, Vrankie!”</p>

<p>“Shut yeour maouth, yeou dinged Dutch chump!”
came from Gallup. “Yeou come nigh fixin’ it so he
couldn’t git him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“Roight ye are, Gallup, me bhoy,” put in Mulloy.
“Thot Dutch chaze is foriver in th’ way.”</p>

<p>To the eyes of Merry the look of amazement on
Oliver Packard’s face seemed genuine.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” Oliver asked. “I heard the
sudden commotion, and then you came leaping down
here at me.”</p>

<p>“Make him give it up, Merry!” cried the students
above.</p>

<p>“I’ve got nothing to give up,” protested Oliver, his
face, which had turned pale, now flushing hotly.
“What do they mean?”</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell was doing some swift thinking
just then. He had not seen Oliver leave the room in
company with Hock Mason, and he had not observed
Roland’s face fairly as the latter whirled with the
snatched envelope in his grasp; but he realized that
Oliver’s actions in the past had stamped him as in
no respect likely to perpetrate such a trick, while it
was very much like his brother.</p>

<p>But it did not seem that Roland had been in the
room. That he would dare come there in the midst of
Merry’s friends seemed utterly beyond reason, and
not worthy of consideration. Yet Frank asked Oliver
a question:</p>

<p>“Where is Roland?”</p>

<p>Again Oliver’s face paled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“Roland?” he said. “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he pass you just now on these stairs?”</p>

<p>“He did not.”</p>

<p>Frank’s face was hard and grim.</p>

<p>“Come up to my room,” he commanded.</p>

<p>Oliver did not demur. He saw Frank’s friends regarding
him with looks of accusation, but, knowing
he was not guilty of any wrong-doing, he quietly ascended
the stairs and entered Merriwell’s room.</p>

<p>At that moment, panting, yet trying to still his
breathing and his thumping heart, Roland Packard
was listening behind the closed door of another room
near Merriwell’s, into which he had darted. He had
seen the door slightly ajar, and had leaped in there as
he fled with the stolen message.</p>

<p>As Oliver, surrounded by Frank’s friends, entered
Merriwell’s room, Roland opened the door the least
bit and cautiously peered out. His ears had told him
something of the truth, and he chuckled to think that
his brother had appeared just in time to fall into the
hands of the pursuers.</p>

<p>“He’s all right,” thought the young scoundrel. “And
he turned up at just the right moment to divert suspicion
from me long enough for me to get away. My
last blow at Merriwell will be effective, and I’ll make
a ten-strike at the same time.”</p>

<p>He saw Merriwell’s door closed by some one who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
meant to make sure that the captured suspect should
not break away and escape. Then Roland stole swiftly
out from the room and hastened down the stairs,
chuckling with evil triumph.</p>

<p>Oliver Packard was in a bad scrape, and somehow
his face seemed to indicate that he felt guilt. Still he
persisted in being told what had happened. When he
heard the story, he firmly said:</p>

<p>“This is a mistake, Merriwell—I swear it! I left
this room ten or fifteen minutes ago in company with
Hock Mason, as I can prove. I left Mason outside
and came back. I was just in time for you to rush
out and grasp me on the stairs. This is the truth, as
Heaven hears me!”</p>

<p>There were murmurs of doubt on all sides. Many
of Merry’s friends had never trusted Oliver fully, being
inclined to judge him by the conduct of his brother.
Some of them had remonstrated with Frank for his
friendliness with Oliver. These were the ones who
now muttered their incredulity on listening to the
words of the suspected student.</p>

<p>Oliver turned pale as he heard that muttering.</p>

<p>“Search him!” said somebody.</p>

<p>“Search him!” was the cry.</p>

<p>“Yes, search me!” panted Oliver. “I demand to be
searched!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Frank, as his hand fell on Oliver’s shoulder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
“I believe you! I am satisfied that you speak
the truth. It is a mistake.”</p>

<p>“But we saw him with the envelope in his hand,”
said Dade Morgan.</p>

<p>“It was not I!” asserted Oliver.</p>

<p>“No, it was not you,” agreed Merriwell, “but it
was one who hates me and who looks so much like
you that we were all deceived.”</p>

<p>“My brother!” muttered Oliver huskily.</p>

<p>“It must have been,” nodded Frank. “He has stolen
that message, which is of great value to me.”</p>

<p>“Merriwell,” exclaimed Oliver Packard excitedly,
“I’ll recover the message for you! Trust me to get
it. I will restore it to you, if I live!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br>

<small>THE FALSE MESSAGE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Roland Packard was exultant as he hastily left
Vanderbilt. Safe in his pocket was the precious message.</p>

<p>“I have it! I have it!” he laughed, as he hastened
away. “Oh, that was a piece of luck! Let Oll fight
it out with them. He’ll get off somehow, and they
never can prove I did it.”</p>

<p>He seemed utterly regardless of the shame and humiliation
he had cast upon his brother by his rascally
act. Having sunk lower and lower, Roland’s conscience
no longer gave him much trouble, no matter
what he did.</p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars!” he muttered. “All mine!
That will clear me of every debt.”</p>

<p>He was hastening to find Anton Mescal, when, of
a sudden, he stopped.</p>

<p>“If that man is willing to pay five hundred dollars
for this message the old envelope must contain something
of great importance.”</p>

<p>That set him to thinking, and soon he softly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what is in that envelope! It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
might be worth much more than five hundred dollars
to me.”</p>

<p>He was on Chapel Street, opposite the green.
Glancing around to make sure he was not watched,
he took the envelope from his pocket and examined it.</p>

<p>“Sealed!” he muttered, in disappointment. “Too
bad! But for that, I might——”</p>

<p>He grew silent, examining the seal.</p>

<p>“This is luck!” he finally laughed. “The seal was
struck with a ring made to represent the symbol of
one of the old freshman societies. The man who
struck that seal may have received the ring from Merriwell
himself. I know where to find another ring exactly
like that.”</p>

<p>Packard thrust the envelope into his pocket and hastened
straight to a jeweler’s shop, where he soon purchased
a ring which he knew would strike a seal exactly
like the one on the envelope.</p>

<p>From the jeweler’s store he went to a stationer’s,
where he purchased a stick of sealing-wax like the wax
used on the oilskin envelope.</p>

<p>Then came the hardest thing to obtain, an envelope
like the one in his pocket; but, after much search,
Packard secured just what he wanted.</p>

<p>“Now, I am going to know what the message is!”
he exulted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>At first he started for his own room, but he did
not go far.</p>

<p>“Oliver may be there,” he thought, “or he may
come before the job is done. I must not go there.”</p>

<p>In a moment he thought of a place, and then he proceeded
straight to a little club-room, where some of
the reckless Yale men often gathered to play cards.</p>

<p>The club-room was deserted now, as everybody
seemed out to take part in the gay time that night.
Roland knew there was little danger that he would
be disturbed, for it was not probable that any Yale
man would care to play cards on such a night.</p>

<p>The place had been lighted by ordinary kerosene-lamps,
and Roland had one of these burning in short
order. Then he set to work to open the envelope. At
first his hands trembled, which caused him to stop
and wait for his nerves to become steadier. He took
a silver flask from his pocket, unscrewed the cap, and
drank from it.</p>

<p>“There!” he said; “that will fix me.”</p>

<p>Slowly and cautiously he worked with his knife,
removing the seal from the envelope. When this was
done he found some trouble in opening the flap without
leaving a trace, but the task was accomplished at
last.</p>

<p>“Now!” he exclaimed, his face flushed and his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
gleaming, “we’ll see what this great message is all
about!”</p>

<p>From the envelope he took several sheets of parchmentlike
paper, which were covered with writing. Then,
by the light of the lamp, he settled himself to read
the message that had never been intended for other
eyes than those of Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p>As Packard read he showed signs of surprise. At
first he whistled softly, then he uttered an exclamation,
and at last he exclaimed aloud:</p>

<p>“Well, by Jove! this is interesting!”</p>

<p>When he had finished reading, he started up, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Frank Merriwell’s fate is in my hands! Almighty
goodness! What a ten-strike! With the aid of this
I can turn him out into the world a pauper! Roland
Packard, this is the greatest piece of work you ever
did. Five hundred dollars! Why, this is worth five
million dollars!”</p>

<p>He was wildly excited, and could hardly repress
wild shouts of joy. Indeed, he executed a savage dance
of exultation.</p>

<p>“At last!” he panted. “Now I am able to obtain
revenge for every injury Merriwell has done me! Oh,
but my revenge will be a sweet one!”</p>

<p>The rascal was so excited and interested that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
again read the wonderful message from beginning to
end.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “to fool Mescal first. He must
pay me the five hundred, for I need it.”</p>

<p>There was some writing-paper on a table near. He
took several sheets, folded them, and thrust them into
the envelope from which the message had been removed.
Then he stuck down the flap with care and
brought out his sealing-wax and the ring he had
purchased.</p>

<p>Removing the chimney from the lamp, he heated
the wax in the flame and dropped it on exactly the
spot where the original seal had been. At the proper
time he pressed the ring on the wax, and an exact
reproduction of the first seal was made.</p>

<p>Packard surveyed his work with pride, examining
it closely to see if a casual observer could detect that
the envelope had been tampered with.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he decided. “I’ll defy anybody to
tell that it has been opened. Oh, I’m a clever devil!
Mr. Merriwell is in the midst of his glory now, but
he shall go out from Yale a beggar! If he only
knew! Some time he shall know. When it is too
late, I’ll tell him all, and that shall be my triumph.”</p>

<p>Then he set about fixing the other envelope, into
which he placed the message, sticking down the flap
and putting on the seal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“All that is necessary is to soil it a little,” he said.
“Then it will be exactly like the original. No—by
George, no!”</p>

<p>He had turned the original envelope and seen the
writing upon it.</p>

<p>“Well,” muttered the fellow, after a few moments.
“I’m rather clever at imitating handwriting, so I’ll
see what I can do in this case.”</p>

<p>Finding pen and ink, he set about the task. At first
he imitated on a sheet of paper the writing on the
original envelope. The first trial was not perfectly
satisfactory, so he made another attempt.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, as he examined it, “if I can do as
well as that on the envelope it will be a first-class
job.”</p>

<p>Without delay he set at work on the envelope,
and the result was greatly to his liking.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he decided, as he blotted it. “I believe
it would fool Merriwell himself.”</p>

<p>He destroyed the sheet on which he had been
practising, and then placed the envelope containing
the message in his pocket, where it would be safe.</p>

<p>“Now to get the five hundred!” he laughed, as he
picked up the other envelope. “Hamlet’s ghost! but
won’t Mr. Anton Mescal be hot under the collar when
he opens this and finds nothing but blank paper in it!”</p>

<p>There was a slight sound at the door. A key turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
in the lock, and Packard leaped to his feet, turning in
time to see the door swing open. Quick as a flash, he
thrust the envelope into his pocket.</p>

<p>Oliver Packard stepped into the room.</p>

<p>“You?” exclaimed Roland.</p>

<p>“Yes!” said Oliver.</p>

<p>He stepped in, closed the door, and locked it.</p>

<p>“Why the devil are you here?” snarled Roland.</p>

<p>“To find you,” said Oliver quietly.</p>

<p>“What do you want of me?”</p>

<p>“I want that message.”</p>

<p>“What message?”</p>

<p>“The one you snatched from Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“What ails you? Are you nutty?”</p>

<p>“Hand it over!” commanded Oliver.</p>

<p>“You go die!” sneered Roland. “You’re silly.”</p>

<p>“I am here to take it, and I shall,” declared Oliver.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>

<p>“What did you put in your pocket just as I entered?”</p>

<p>“None of your business!”</p>

<p>“I know what it was.”</p>

<p>“Then if you know so much, why do you ask me?”</p>

<p>“It was the message.”</p>

<p>“What are you giving me about a message?”</p>

<p>“It’s no use to play innocent with me, Roll.”</p>

<p>Roland uttered a savage exclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“You get out of here!” he cried, taking a step.</p>

<p>Oliver did not stir.</p>

<p>“I’ll go when you give me what I am after,” he
said.</p>

<p>“I’ll give it to you—in the neck!”</p>

<p>“Roll,” said Oliver quietly, “you can’t bluff me. I
know you snatched a message from Frank Merriwell’s
hand to-night, and you have it with you. I was accused,
but Merriwell believed me on my word of
honor.”</p>

<p>“That’s more than he would me,” said Roland, with
a harsh laugh.</p>

<p>“You have only yourself to blame if no one will
believe your word of honor,” said Oliver.</p>

<p>“Sermon, is it?” cried the other. “You’re always
preaching nowadays, Oll.”</p>

<p>“It’s no sermon now, for I have no time to waste.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it. Get out and let me alone.”</p>

<p>“I shall not go till I get what I came for. I will
clear myself of suspicion, and I will restore to Merriwell
what rightfully belongs to him.”</p>

<p>“You’ve tackled a big job.”</p>

<p>“I shall do it.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Somehow—anyhow. You have disgraced me time
and again, Roll, and I have stood it for mother’s sake.
She loves you more than she does me, and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Oh, cut it out! You’ve told me this before.”</p>

<p>“But for me you would have broken her heart already.”</p>

<p>“Good little Oliver! he was his mammy’s precious
boy!” mocked Roll. “Oh, you make me sick!”</p>

<p>“You know what I say is true. But for me you
would have been expelled in disgrace before this. I
have saved you when Frank Merriwell was ready to
punish you for your wrong-doing. How have you repaid
me! To-day you have done something that has
filled me with intense shame and humiliation. Yet I
do not believe you care a snap.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use?”</p>

<p>“Ingrate!” panted Oliver, aroused.</p>

<p>“Bah!” returned the other, snapping his fingers.</p>

<p>Oll advanced into the room, his eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“Before this I have shouldered the blame that you
should have taken,” he cried. “Your actions have
caused me to be dropped by my best friends, with the
exception of Merriwell. Your actions caused me to
lose my chance of making the nine again this year. I
have endured all that I can. The limit is reached.”</p>

<p>“Now what?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to cut clear from you.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it!”</p>

<p>“But first I am going to restore that stolen message
to Merriwell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, go ahead.”</p>

<p>Roland was defiant.</p>

<p>“Give it to me!” panted Oliver, his hands clenched,
while he trembled in every limb. “I demand it!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have to demand. You won’t get it.”</p>

<p>“You can’t get out without giving it to me, Roll,”
asserted Oliver grimly, as he now advanced upon his
brother.</p>

<p>“What do you think you are going to do?” demanded
the young rascal. “Don’t make an idiot of
yourself!”</p>

<p>Oliver clutched his brother by the collar.</p>

<p>“Give it up!” he commanded. “I’ll take it if I have
to strip your clothes off to do so.”</p>

<p>Roland laughed defiantly. Then he suddenly broke
Oliver’s hold and struck the hand of his brother
aside.</p>

<p>A moment later Oliver flew at Roland with terrible
fury, grasping him by the throat.</p>

<p>Then began a desperate encounter between the brothers.
Roland found Oliver desperate and determined.
For at least ten minutes they fought, and at last Oliver
had thrown his brother to the floor and pinned him
there. Then he thrust his hand into Roland’s pocket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
and drew out the envelope that the youthful villain
had prepared to deceive Anton Mescal.</p>

<p>“I have it!” exclaimed Oliver triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Well, keep it!” grated Roland, inwardly delighted
over the fact that the message was safe and Oliver
was deceived. “Let me up! You ought to be satisfied.”</p>

<p>Having put the letter in his pocket, Oliver quickly
leaped to his feet and backed away, saying:</p>

<p>“I am satisfied in getting the message, but I’d had
it even though you had forced me to kill you!”</p>

<p>“You’re a nice one!” snapped Roland, sitting up.
“You’re a fine brother to have!”</p>

<p>“I can return the compliment with interest. But
never again will I shoulder any of your wrong-doing,
Roland. If you get into a bad scrape in the future
through your actions, you must not look to me for
assistance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t! Don’t worry about that. After to-night
we are no longer brothers! You are my enemy!”</p>

<p>“I have been your best friend. You have made
your choice by your conduct.”</p>

<p>Oliver had retreated to the door, still watching
Roland, who now laughed and said:</p>

<p>“Get out if you want to; I sha’n’t try to stop you.
I’ll not fight again over that old message. I don’t
believe it amounts to anything, anyhow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Oliver unlocked the door cautiously, for he did not
trust Roland, even then.</p>

<p>“I shall tell Merriwell the truth,” he said, “and I
shall not ask him to let you off without punishment,
as I have in the past. He may punish you or not, as
he chooses. If he does not, it will be because he is
the soul of generosity.”</p>

<p>Then he opened the door and disappeared quickly,
closing it behind him.</p>

<p>Roland Packard laughed in noiseless triumph.</p>

<p>“Go it, you fool!” he whispered. “I have the message,
and you have nothing but an envelope containing
a lot of blank paper. I’d like to see Merriwell’s face
when he opens that envelope!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br>

<small>CELEBRATION OF THE OLD GRADS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The celebration was in progress. Frank Merriwell,
with Inza Burrage at his side, was watching the fun
from Vanderbilt. Frank’s heart was troubled because
of the loss of the message, but his face was
smiling.</p>

<p>The class of ’Umpty-six was celebrating its silver-wedding.
Twenty-five years had passed since these
hilarious old grads received their sheepskins. They
were back in force, and they had set out to make
things lively.</p>

<p>The great dinner at Heibs’ was over. But, unless
one eats the dinner, what profit to describe it. So the
class of ’Umpty-six made merry on this occasion of
hilarious good cheer. After twenty-five years the
class had returned to dear old Yale, dined in the
shadow of her buildings, and drunk often and lovingly
to the memory of bygone days.</p>

<p>A band awaited those sons of ’Umpty-six outside
the door. The toasts were over, so that now they
were ready to start upon their night of fun. What
though their hair is streaked with gray! What though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
some are bewhiskered to the eyes! Have they not left
dignity, business cares, and such minor matters at
home?</p>

<p>The band struck up, “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow.”
The ’Umpty-sixers came out of Heibs’, arm in
arm. They caught up the song, and, in full blare, the
band moved toward Chapel Street, the grads following.
They turn into Chapel Street, which, even at
this hour, is brilliantly lighted, for no one thinks of
sleep to-night. And thus they move toward Osborne
Hall.</p>

<p>On that corner, where is now the sober recitation
hall, for half a century stood the old Yale fence, the
focus of college life, the scene of storied struggles,
the theater of evening glees, the symbol of happy days
at Yale.</p>

<p>But now the old fence is gone. However, nothing
will do for these old grads but that a substitute,
propped up by iron supports, must be set in front of
Osborn, and thither the jolly old ’Umpty-sixers direct
their course.</p>

<p>“To the fence! Clear the road! Let off the red
fire! Turn loose the sky-rockets and Roman candles,
and cram the night full of blooming noise!”</p>

<p>Up Chapel Street they come in a flare of colored
fire, with the rockets hissing skyward, the Roman
candles popping aloft their gleaming balls of colored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
flame, while torpedoes and giant crackers add to the
racket.</p>

<p>The windows of the New Haven House are filled
with women and pretty girls who had been watching
the hilarious crowd of grads across the street all
the evening. This is a new and wild scene to them,
and now, when they behold the ’Umpty-sixers come
singing and dancing up to the fence, not a few are
more than ever impressed by the fact that it is a dangerous
thing to turn a Yale graduate loose on old New
Haven town upon the occasion of one of his class
reunions.</p>

<p>“’Umpty-sixers, take the fence!” goes up the cry.</p>

<p>There follows a rush of the old fellows, all eager
to gain a place on the fence.</p>

<p>Then the band plays all the old college songs, and
for several hours to come these hilarious old gray-beards
will bawl and howl to the strains of the
band.</p>

<p>But ’Umpty-six is not the only class mixed up in
this general blow-out. Other and younger classes
are there, back for occasions of lesser significance than
the silver-wedding. Nearly a thousand Yale men are
surging about Osborn corner, which is kept brilliantly
lighted by the glare of Egyptian red lights. Judging
by the deafening noise, it would seem that the entire
stock of fireworks in the city must have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
set off already. But they will keep coming in wagon-loads.</p>

<p>And in the midst of all this tumultuous rejoicing
the man who has won for Yale the baseball championship
of the season is not forgotten.</p>

<p>“Long cheer for Merriwell!” shrieks an ’Umpty-sixer.</p>

<p>Then the whole vast crowd of Yale men pause
to roar out the cheer for a Yale man who to-night is
more famous than all others.</p>

<p>No wonder that Merriwell himself felt a thrill.
No wonder some of his friends laughed while their
eyes were dimmed with tears.</p>

<p>And on his arm was the pressure of a hand—the
hand of the girl he loved. And at his side was a
radiantly beautiful girl, who felt that on this day of
his glory her joy must be even greater than his.</p>

<p>Hans Dunnerwurst was sobbing.</p>

<p>“Whut in thunder is the matter with yeou?” blurted
Ephraim Gallup, giving the Dutch youth a punch.</p>

<p>“I don’d knew vot id vos,” answered Hans, “but I
veel like I vos peing tickled a fedder by till I couldn’t
stood him no longer alretty.”</p>

<p>“Begorra! Oi fale loike Oi’d nivver get over it!”
said Barney Mulloy. “Oi’ll drame av this fer a year.”</p>

<p>Elsie is there. She is saying nothing, but the joy
in her blue eyes speaks. She looks at Frank as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
that mighty cheer for him rolls up to the rocket-riven
sky. She sees Inza’s hand on Frank’s arm, and then—then
she turns to Hodge.</p>

<p>Bart, once called selfish, feels that he is far happier
than he would be were those men cheering for him.
A good, true friend Bart had been, and in this hour
there is nothing of envy in his heart.</p>

<p>Why should there be? Elsie was beside him, and,
somehow, he felt that for all of Frank’s great glory,
for all of bewildering, dark-eyed Inza, he—Bart—had
won the prize of prizes.</p>

<p>“Speech!” shouted an ’Umpty-sixer, as the cheering
subsided.</p>

<p>“Speech! Speech!” roared the others.</p>

<p>“Speech by Billy Bilton, the only and original
windmill of ’Umpty-six!” cried an old grad. “Put
him up—put him in the wagon with the fireworks!
Shoot off your face, Billy! Billy Bilton!”</p>

<p>“Billy Bilton! ’Umpty-six!” roared the crowd.</p>

<p>Billy Bilton was the Honorable William P. Bilton,
representative in Congress for the great and glorious
Commonwealth of Maine. Billy smiled, and that smile
was something worth beholding! He removed the
cigar from his mouth and held it between his fingers.</p>

<p>“My contemporaries,” he began, pointing with the
cigar toward the fireworks in the wagon, “have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
doing such good work that I feel handicapped. But
I want to say that the greatest thing in this great
university on this great night, next to the great class
of ’Umpty-six, is the great Frank Merriwell!”</p>

<p>Then they cheered again.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Billy, when he could again be heard,
“I want to tell you what Frank Merriwell has done
for Yale. He has made for her the proudest athletic
record of any college in the country. Since
the day that he was placed in command not one important
game has been taken from us. It was he
who arose in time to lift Yale from the slough of
despond into which she had fallen, and it was he
who has led her to the dazzling heights of glory where
she now stands. That’s not all. While he has uplifted
Yale he has risen himself, until to-day he is
known from the broad Atlantic to the blue Pacific.
Yea, wherever the flag of our country floats, the glorious
Stars and Stripes, there has spread the name and
fame and glory of Merriwell, of Yale.”</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to continue until they
had cheered again.</p>

<p>“Even to foreign lands his glory has spread,” the
speaker went on. “Wherever the English language
is spoken the name of Merriwell may be heard. From
the Klondike to Patagonia, from the Philippines to
South Africa, he is known and admired and reverenced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
as the model American youth. Old men commend
him to the young, the young try to model after
him, and even the child at its mother’s knee lisps the
name of Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say!” muttered Frank; “he’s putting it on too
thick! I can’t stand this!”</p>

<p>But Billy was ready to switch now, although he had
no thought of stopping. He waved his hand, and
sparks flew from his glowing cigar.</p>

<p>“Now,” he shouted, “I want to tell you what ’Umpty-six
has done for Yale. ’Umpty-six is the greatest
class that ever graduated from Yale!” he declared,
with another wild gesture that caused him to drop his
cigar. “’Umpty-six is——”</p>

<p>Bang—barked a cannon cracker in the wagon.</p>

<p>“’Umpty-six——”</p>

<p>Bang! bang! bang!</p>

<p>A series of terrible explosions set William to dancing
in a lively manner, for his fallen cigar had ignited
the fireworks in the wagon.</p>

<p>The horse attached to the wagon was frightened
and broke away, despite all efforts to hold him.</p>

<p>Immediately the Honorable William lost his footing
and fell upon his knees in the wagon, while away
pranced the horse at a mad gallop. The orator was
kneeling in the midst of a pyrotechnic display of hissing
Roman candles, flaming red lights, bursting cannon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
crackers, and screaming rockets. Jack Ready afterward
declared that it was a grand and awe-inspiring
spectacle.</p>

<p>“There goes Windy Billy!” shouted the crowd, and
every man, to the last one, started after the blazing
wagon and the most startling piece of set fireworks
ever seen in New Haven, which was long remembered
by the name of “The American Representative
in All His Glory.”</p>

<p>As the wagon disappeared Frank Merriwell, who
was laughing at the astonishing climax, felt a hand
on his shoulder. He turned and saw Oliver Packard.</p>

<p>“I have found you at last,” said Packard. “I’ve
been hunting for you more than two hours.”</p>

<p>“I have been right here all along,” said Frank.
“What do you want, Oliver?”</p>

<p>“I have brought it,” was the triumphant answer,
as Packard put his hand into his pocket and drew
out the sealed oilskin envelope. “Here it is, Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Merry, in great satisfaction, as
he immediately thrust it into his pocket. “I’ll take
care it is not snatched from me again. I’ll ask you
no questions, Oliver, and I’ll not forget what you
have done.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br>

<small>ANTON MESCAL STRIKES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Roland Packard had fancied he might be forced to
destroy the original oilskin envelope in removing the
message from it, and for that reason he had secured
a duplicate. When he succeeded in getting the message
out without destroying the original envelope,
he decided that the best thing to do was to place the
blank paper in that same envelope, as the clean newness
of the other might betray the trick. Then he
was seized by a desire to put the message in the other
envelope and copy as accurately as possible the writing
upon it, which he did.</p>

<p>The villainous student chuckled gleefully as he
thought how his brother had been deceived.</p>

<p>“I have the message safe in my pocket,” he muttered,
“while Oll is taking the fake to Merriwell. But
must I give up this genuine article in order to get the
five hundred from Mescal?”</p>

<p>He was not at all pleased by the thought. In fact,
he quickly decided not to give up the message, if he
could help it. He set to thinking the matter over, and
it was not long before he had decided on his course
of action. He left the club-room and skulked away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
to his own room, taking care to attract as little attention
as possible.</p>

<p>The following morning Roland secured another oilskin
envelope. Knowing Oliver would be off to the
exercises of the day, he sought his own room and
prepared the envelope there.</p>

<p>When he came out the seniors, in caps and gowns,
were assembling at the chapel, into which a crowd
of visitors was flowing.</p>

<p>“Merriwell will be there in all his glory!” muttered
Packard to himself. “He will be the cynosure of all
eyes. Oh, he’ll feel proud and fine, but little he’ll
dream that it is my hand that will send him forth from
Yale a pauper.”</p>

<p>The chapel was thronged with visitors when the
exercises began, and Packard was right in thinking
that Merriwell would be the center of attraction.</p>

<p>In the meantime Packard had sought Anton Mescal,
whom he finally found in a room at the Tontine.
Mescal had a bottle of wine on the table at his elbow,
and was smoking a Spanish cigarette. His face was
flushed and his eyes gleamed wolfishly when Roland
entered. He did not rise, but regarded the student
grimly.</p>

<p>“I’ve come,” said Packard, with an air of triumph.</p>

<p>“I see you have,” said Mescal coldly, showing his
white teeth after the manner of a wolf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“You do not appear glad to see me.”</p>

<p>“But I am glad—very glad,” said the man from the
West, in a very singular way.</p>

<p>Packard paused, and a shiver ran over him. There
was something deadly in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” invited Mescal, in that same awesome
manner, making a slight gesture toward a chair.</p>

<p>“I had a hard time getting the message,” began
Packard awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Then you did get it?” asked Mescal.</p>

<p>“Yes. When I set out to do a thing, I have a way
of doing it. But you do not seem much pleased.”</p>

<p>“I am pleased—very pleased. Go on. How did
you get it?”</p>

<p>“I went straight to Merriwell’s room in the tracks
of the man you bade me follow.”</p>

<p>“To Merriwell’s room?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I could not get a chance to tackle the fellow
and secure the message. You know the streets
were full.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If I had tackled him on the street I must have
failed, and I would have been lodged in the jug.”</p>

<p>“Possibly. Go on.”</p>

<p>The manner of the Westerner had not changed in
the least, and Roland felt that those daggerlike eyes
were piercing him through and through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Merriwell’s room was packed with his friends, who
were there to congratulate him. I walked right in
after the messenger.”</p>

<p>“Very bold of you!”</p>

<p>“The messenger took the message from his pocket
and handed it over to Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“I was near enough to spring forward and snatch
it from Merriwell’s hand.”</p>

<p>“But you did not?”</p>

<p>“I did! I snatched it and fled. I eluded the pursuers
and got away with it. Of course, they were
searching for me last night, so I was compelled to lay
low. But I am here now.”</p>

<p>“And you have the message?”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>Mescal rose to his feet, and the look on his face
seemed to become more dangerous than ever.</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Here,” said Packard, also rising.</p>

<p>From his pocket he took the fake envelope, which he
held in his hand.</p>

<p>“Give me the five hundred dollars,” he demanded.
“It is yours the moment you pay me the money.”</p>

<p>Mescal stepped clear of the table, and by a sudden
spring placed himself between Packard and the door.
He was like a panther in his movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“What’s the matter with you?” asked Roland, in
alarm. “What are you doing? Don’t think for a
moment that you can take the message from me without
paying the money.”</p>

<p>“You fool!” said Mescal, in a low tone. “You liar!
You traitor!”</p>

<p>Packard saw there was trouble in the air. He
wondered if in any manner this man could have discovered
his trick.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by calling me such names?”
he blustered.</p>

<p>“I mean just what I have said; you are a fool,
a liar, and a traitor. You came here to deceive me!”</p>

<p>“To deceive you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“With that thing!” said the man, pointing at the
oilskin envelope. “It does not contain the message!”</p>

<p>Packard was astounded, but he resolved to make a
good bluff.</p>

<p>“What are you saying?” he exclaimed, pretending
to be much astonished. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that I know your game to beat me out
of five hundred dollars! I mean that I was watching
you last night! I mean that I saw you when you
went to Merriwell and gave the message to him with
your own hand!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>Roland gasped.</p>

<p>“Went to him—and gave him—the message?” he
faltered. “Why, man, you are——” Then he paused,
uttering a little cry, as a sudden light broke on him.</p>

<p>It was Oliver this fellow had watched! It was
Oliver he had seen give the fake envelope to Merriwell!</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” he said swiftly, although he
could not quite see how he was going to make things
clear. “I have a twin brother who looks exactly like
me. You saw him.”</p>

<p>For one moment Mescal seemed surprised, and then
a dangerous laugh came from his lips.</p>

<p>“And what was your twin brother doing with the
message?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Roland choked and hesitated. That hesitation
seemed to fan the man to a burst of fury.</p>

<p>“Fool!” he hissed, crouching. “You have tried to
deceive the wrong man! Had you known me better
you would not have done so! In my body flows the
blood of the Spaniard, and I never forgive an injury!
You betrayed me, and I will settle with you
as we settle such scores in the West!”</p>

<p>Out flashed a slender dagger in his hand. Roland
uttered a cry of fear as Mescal leaped upon him. The
student tried to defend himself, but Mescal’s blade rose
and fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“You devil!” gasped Packard. “You have stabbed
me.”</p>

<p>Then, as Roland sank to his knees, Mescal broke
away, flung the blood-stained dagger on the floor, and
bounded to the door. One backward look he took
as he disappeared, seeing the bleeding youth upon the
floor.</p>

<p>Then he fled from the hotel and from New Haven.</p>

<p>Packard was not fatally wounded. The dagger had
pierced the muscle of his arm, and the point had penetrated
his side as far as a rib. The wound in the arm
was the most painful, and the other was not dangerous.
In the hospital Roland was skilfully treated,
but he persistently refused to tell how or by whom
he had been wounded.</p>

<p>Nor would he stay in the hospital when he found
that his wound was not at all dangerous if properly
cared for. He came out that afternoon and returned
to the college.</p>

<p>He found the afternoon exercises on the campus
taking place. The place was like an open arena, with
temporary seats rising in tiers all round it. Those
seats were packed with human beings, spectators and
friends of the students. Already the classes had
marched in, led by the band, and assembled on the
benches in the middle of the arena, where they now
sat sedately smoking long clay pipes and wearing caps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
and gowns. They were listening to the historians of
the class, who were reading the class histories.</p>

<p>Packard looked on, feeling that something was occurring
in which he had no part and no interest. His
arm was in a sling, and this last enemy of Merriwell
at Yale looked a forlorn and wretched figure.</p>

<p>The histories read by the different historians had
been full of hits upon the various members of the class.
As a man’s name was called his companions lifted him
upon their shoulders, while his history was given to
the strained ears of the gathering. He was compelled
to submit gracefully, but some of those sharp
hits caused the victims to look like fresh-boiled lobsters.</p>

<p>The historian was reading when Packard reached a
spot where he could see and hear. Bruce Browning
was held aloft upon the shoulders of his fellows. When
it was finished, Browning was lowered, and up came
Bart Hodge as his name was mentioned.</p>

<p>“Merriwell’s friends!” muttered Packard bitterly.
“Everybody seems to be Merriwell’s friend to-day.
I’m the only one of the whole howling pack who has
remained his enemy. He has conquered them all, but
I’ll conquer him!”</p>

<p>Then Hodge was lowered. There was a stir. The
name of Merriwell came from the lips of the historian.
Instantly something remarkable took place. Merry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
was lifted and held aloft, but every man on these
benches rose to his feet. It was a tribute to Frank,
and the great crowd of watching spectators caught
the feeling. Up rose that mass of men and women
and youths and girls in one great surge, standing for
the moment to do honor to the most famous college
man in the world. It was a spectacle never forgotten
at Yale.</p>

<p>Then those students who were not holding Frank
aloft sat down, and the spectators followed their example.</p>

<p>The historian, his voice ringing out clear and strong,
delivered a blood-stirring eulogy on Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Bah!” muttered Packard, and, sick at heart, he
slunk away, unwilling to listen to those words of adulation
for one he hated with undying intensity.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon, when the exercises were all
over, Oliver Packard found Roland in the room they
had occupied together. Oliver was surprised when
he saw his brother’s arm in a sling, and he asked what
had happened.</p>

<p>“None of your business!” answered Roland surlily.</p>

<p>“You are hurt?” exclaimed Oliver, forgetting that
he had vowed he would take no further interest in
his wayward brother. “What is it, Roll! Won’t you
tell me how badly you are hurt?”</p>

<p>“Go to the devil!” snarled Roland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Oliver sat down, a look of sadness on his face. For
some time he sat in silence; but he spoke at last.</p>

<p>“Where were you while the exercises were taking
place to-day?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That’s my business,” said Roland.</p>

<p>“You should have been there. If you had, it’s
possible your arm would not be in a sling now. Roland,
I have returned the message to Merriwell, and
I feel that he will take no action against you. I did
not ask him not to do so, for I have been forced to
ask him so many times before that I was ashamed.”</p>

<p>“Then I owe you no thanks.”</p>

<p>“No; but you do owe him something. Is the last
spark of honor and the last particle of justice driven
from your heart? Can’t you see where you have
placed yourself by your conduct toward this man, who
to-day has been honored as no Yale man ever before
was honored?”</p>

<p>“Honored by fools!” growled Roland.</p>

<p>“Honored by the wisest men in college! Honored
by every one! If you had seen every person in that
great crowd on the campus rise when his name was
spoken by the historian——”</p>

<p>“I did see it, and then I got away.”</p>

<p>“Then you were there? But you were not in your
place.”</p>

<p>“If I had been, they would have seen that one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
college man did not rise when Merriwell’s name was
called.”</p>

<p>“And you would have brought on yourself the scorn
of every one. Can’t you see that by his generosity, his
fine character, and manliness, he has risen far above
you?”</p>

<p>“No! I see that he has a trick of fooling everybody
but me. He can make his enemies forget that they
were once enemies, but I am not like the others. I
want to tell you something, Oll. You think Merriwell
has triumphed, but you are wrong. I am the
one who has triumphed, though no one save myself
knows it. Some time Merriwell shall know, and then
he will realize that one of his enemies was more than
a match for him.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Oliver, amazed. “Are
you crazy?”</p>

<p>“Never mind what I mean, but I speak the truth. I
have triumphed, and Merriwell is my victim. I’ll
talk no more about it, so you may as well close your
face.”</p>

<p>And Oliver could get nothing further from his
brother.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br>

<small>THE END COMES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The day of graduation came. The sun shone bright
and clear on this great day in the life of Frank Merriwell,
but still that feeling of sadness was lingering
in his heart, for he felt that he was bidding farewell
to his dear home.</p>

<p>Frank had competed to be a Townsend teacher,
and he had been chosen one of the fortunate six who
were to speak for the DeForest gold medal.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that he was given little time for
thought and little in which to see his friends, all of
whom were eager to be in his company.</p>

<p>Had he known that the oilskin envelope in his possession
contained nothing but blank paper it is not
probable he could have spoken as brilliantly as he did.</p>

<p>When the speaking was over it was generally conceded
that the handsome medal must go to Merriwell.</p>

<p>The faculty adjourned to the Treasury building,
and there Frank was awarded the splendid prize. Each
member of the faculty shook his hand in turn and
spoke some word of praise to him. They looked on
him lovingly, for they knew that he had done more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
to raise the standard of college life than any other
student in the country.</p>

<p>Frank was on his way to his room when he almost
collided with Roland Packard.</p>

<p>Packard had been drinking heavily, and he stopped,
his lip curling in a scornful sneer.</p>

<p>“You think you’re it, Merriwell,” he said, in a tone
of great contempt; “but, if you only knew it, you are
the biggest fool alive.”</p>

<p>Frank had no desire to exchange words with the
fellow.</p>

<p>“You’re drunk, Packard,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“You’re a liar, Merriwell!” snarled Packard, who
seemed not to have a single remnant of reason left.</p>

<p>Frank was not in the habit of taking the lie from
anybody, but now, seeing Packard’s arm in a sling,
he did not heed the fellow’s insult.</p>

<p>“Your friends think you’re a great gun,” Roland
went on; “but you really are mighty small potatoes.
Won the DeForest prize, did you? Well, you may
have to pawn it soon to get bread to keep you from
starving!”</p>

<p>This did not have the effect Roland had fancied
it might, which angered him to a still further expression
of rage.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re mighty cool; but you won’t be so cool
when you find you’re a beggar! And you are! I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
know what I’m talking about. You will find it out in
time, and I want to tell you now that it is I—I, Roland
Packard, whom you despise, who has made you a
beggar! Don’t forget it!”</p>

<p>He wheeled and walked swiftly away.</p>

<p>Frank stood still and looked after the fellow.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he meant,” Merry muttered, a feeling
of uneasiness in his breast. “Is he plumb daffy?
I know he’s pretty drunk, but still it seems that he
must have some reason left.”</p>

<p>Frank was troubled despite himself, and he hurried
to his room, where he made sure the oilskin envelope
was still safe in his possession.</p>

<p>Packard had hurried away to drink still more. Already
he was half-crazed by liquor, but he felt consumed
by a burning fire that called for more, more,
more.</p>

<p>The afternoon of graduation-day came and saw all
graduating students in caps and gowns, headed by the
faculty, likewise garbed, march to the music of a band
out of the campus and down Elm Street to the green,
which they crossed, turning up Chapel Street to Vanderbilt.
The gates of Vanderbilt are opened but once
a year, always on this occasion, and through the gates
they marched, under the arch and across the campus.
The chapel was entered, and then came the last solemn
ceremony of conferring the degrees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>Frank thrilled when he stood up to receive his sheepskin.
There was a choking in his throat, his sensation
was a mingled feeling of joy and sorrow that was
like exquisite pain. His face was pale as marble.
When the certificate was placed in his hand he felt
that it was the document that divorced him from dear
old Yale, and he sat down with his teeth clenched to
hold back the moan that sought vent.</p>

<p>It was over!</p>

<p>That afternoon a man was seen reeling over the
Barnesville bridge. He was intoxicated, and he seemed
to fancy he was pursued by an enemy or enemies who
sought his life. Filled with mad terror, he climbed
upon the railing not far from the eastern end of
the bridge and flung himself headlong into the river.</p>

<p>Several persons had seen this crazy act, and they
rushed to rescue him, if possible. Two men pulled
out in a boat toward the spot where he had last been
seen. As they pulled he rose to the surface, made a
few feeble splashes, and sank.</p>

<p>One of the men stripped off his coat and plunged
in. He brought the drowning fellow up, helped the
other man get him into the boat, crawled in himself,
and they pulled ashore.</p>

<p>On the shore men worked nearly an hour over the
poor wretch, but all their efforts were unavailing. He
was dead. In his pocket they found some letters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
which told them he was a student and that his name
was Roland Packard.</p>

<p>And thus it came about that in the pocket of his
dead brother Oliver Packard found another envelope
that looked exactly like the one Roland had snatched
from Merriwell. He was astonished and puzzled, but
he took it to Merriwell.</p>

<p>“One of them must contain the message, Merriwell,”
said Oliver, whose face was marked with deep
sorrow.</p>

<p>“To-morrow will tell,” said Frank, “for then I will
open them both.” He took Oliver’s hand. “I am very
sorry, Packard,” he said.</p>

<p>“It is for the best,” declared Oliver; but his chin
quivered as he turned away.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br>

<small>THE MESSAGE STOLEN AGAIN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“The time has come!”</p>

<p>The words came from the lips of Frank Merriwell,
who was standing beside a small table in a room of
one of New York’s big hotels. In his hand he held
the two oilskin envelopes. Across each envelope had
been written:</p>

<p>“To Frank Merriwell; to be opened the day after
he graduates from Yale.”</p>

<p>Frank had studied the writing on those envelopes,
and he was convinced that the words on one had
been imitated and copied from the other.</p>

<p>Bart Hodge was Merry’s companion, sitting near
and showing no small amount of interest in the singular
envelopes.</p>

<p>“Which contains the message?” was the question
that came from Bart’s lips.</p>

<p>“That is a conundrum,” admitted Frank, as he gazed
from one to the other.</p>

<p>“This is the one Oliver Packard returned that night
the old grads were celebrating on Osborne corner.”</p>

<p>“Which one is that, the original or the fake?”</p>

<p>“The original.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“Then what do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“I believe it does not contain the message. I believe
the original envelope was opened by Roland
Packard.”</p>

<p>“Why did he do that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, unless he expected he would have to
give up something and was determined to hang on to
the real message. I am convinced that there was
somebody behind Roland Packard. He was not working
on his own hook. The messenger was pursued all
the way from Colorado to New Haven by a man who
seemed determined to do him injury. That man
failed, but is it not possible he instigated the action of
Roland Packard?”</p>

<p>“And you think the stranger employed him to get
hold of the message?”</p>

<p>“I have arrived at that belief.”</p>

<p>“Still, that does not explain the fake envelope.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that Roland Packard’s curiosity was
aroused and he determined to find out what the original
envelope contained. He opened it. In fact, having
studied and examined this envelope closely, I
think I can detect indications that it has been broken
open.”</p>

<p>“Then it is likely that Oliver Packard did not restore
to you the message, after all.”</p>

<p>“Not in this first envelope, but you know he brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
me this other, which was taken from the body of his
dead brother.”</p>

<p>“Then it is possible that the second envelope is the
one that contains the message.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Frank. “I almost dread to open it,
although the time to do so has come. Something
seems to whisper that it contains a great surprise for
me.”</p>

<p>Frank sat down beside the table, and, with a firm
hand, tore open the envelope he regarded as the original.
An exclamation escaped his lips as he drew
forth the contents.</p>

<p>“Look, Bart!” he cried. “I was right! Nothing
but blank paper!”</p>

<p>He held the unsoiled sheets up before the eyes of
his almost breathless companion.</p>

<p>“By Jove! you were right!” said Hodge. “You have
a way of figuring things out correctly, Merriwell. The
other envelope must contain the message.”</p>

<p>But, strange to say, Merriwell seemed to hesitate
again.</p>

<p>“What if it should not!” he muttered. “What if
that also contains nothing but blank paper!”</p>

<p>“But it must contain the message!” exclaimed Bart.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because—because the message was not in this
one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“A poor reason, Bart. It’s likely this envelope was
fixed to deceive the man who employed Roland Packard
to secure the message. I presume that man offered
Packard money to get the message and turn it
over to him. Packard’s curiosity was aroused, and
he decided to find out what the message contained,
which led him to remove it from the envelope. Then
he fixed up the original envelope to deceive the man
who had paid him to do the crooked work, but his
brother took it from him in the fight. Following that
it is likely that he fixed up this other envelope for the
purpose of fooling his rascally employer. In such a
case, it is almost certain that envelope No. 2 contains
blank paper, the same as the first.”</p>

<p>“Open it!” panted Hodge.</p>

<p>“That will settle it,” said Frank, as he did so.</p>

<p>Bart was rigid as a marble image as Merry drew the
contents of the envelope forth.</p>

<p>From Frank’s lips came a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“It is the message!” he said.</p>

<p>Had he not been so preoccupied, so absorbed, Frank
Merriwell would have heard the slight rustling sound
in the alcove bedroom behind him. In times of expected
danger his alertness was something remarkable,
but just now his mind was concentrated on the mysterious
message which he had taken from the envelope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>Nor did Bart hear anything to arouse his suspicions.</p>

<p>A slight breeze came through the open bedroom
window, and gently stirred the portières behind
Frank’s back.</p>

<p>Merriwell’s face grew very pale as he read the opening
words of the message, and his watching companion
knew something had produced a profound effect
on him.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Bart was compelled to ask.</p>

<p>“It is from my father, as I believed,” said Merriwell,
plainly making an effort to steady his voice. “I have
read nothing but the opening sentence, but this is what
it says:</p>

<p>“‘This, my son, is the confession of your father,
who, near to the point of death and beyond all hope
of recovery, is lying in the cabin of Juan Delores, near
Urmiston, which is about fifty miles from Denver.’”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Hodge. “Your father
dying?”</p>

<p>“Dead by this time, it is likely,” came sadly from
Frank’s lips. “And I not near in his last moments!”</p>

<p>The expression of regret and grief on Frank’s face
was sincere and profound.</p>

<p>“Too bad!” muttered Bart. “But he always was
such a strange man!”</p>

<p>“Strange, indeed,” nodded Frank. “I knew little of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
his life after he went to seek his fortune amid the
mines, save that part which is closely connected with
his fight against his great enemy, Santenel. He told
me that portion of it, but concerning the rest he has
said little or nothing.”</p>

<p>“This may throw light upon it. He calls it a confession.”</p>

<p>“And the fact that he has called it that makes me
hesitate once more about reading. But it must be
done.”</p>

<p>Again Merry lifted the message to read.</p>

<p>Over his shoulder darted a hand that snatched the
message from his grasp!</p>

<p>At the same moment, uttering a cry of warning,
Bart Hodge sprang to his feet, pointing toward the
parted portières behind Merriwell.</p>

<p>Merry shot to his feet like a flash, but he was barely
in time to see a man disappearing between the portières.</p>

<p>A second time had the precious message been
snatched from his fingers.</p>

<p>“Stop him!” shouted Hodge.</p>

<p>Merry was first to leap between the portières, and
yet he was barely in time to see a man disappearing
through a window that led out upon a fire-escape.</p>

<p>A single glimpse of the man’s face Merriwell obtained
as he plunged after him. He saw him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
entering the open window of an adjoining room, the
fire-escape running from one window to the other.</p>

<p>At a single bound Frank reached the other window
and followed the man into the room. The fugitive
was passing out through a door that led into the hall
as Merry jumped in by the window.</p>

<p>Toward that door bounded Merry. It was slammed
in his face.</p>

<p>It had a spring-lock, and for a moment it bothered
Frank, who was compelled to pause to open it. By
that time Hodge had reached the window of the room,
into which he looked in great surprise, seeing that
Merry was there alone.</p>

<p>“Where is the——” Frank heard no more of Bart’s
question, for he tore open the door and leaped out
into the corridor.</p>

<p>The fugitive had disappeared.</p>

<p>Frank went dashing along the passage, looking for
the man, but seeing nothing of him. The fellow had
disappeared in a most remarkable manner after leaving
the room.</p>

<p>“Search, Hodge!” called Merry, and Bart joined in
the hunt.</p>

<p>But though they searched everywhere, they found
nothing of the man they were after. The hotel was
aroused. The clerk in the office was notified, and he
sent the hotel detective to join in the search.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>But, after an hour of hunting, the searchers were
forced to give up, as the unknown thief had not been
found.</p>

<p>Then Merry went to the office and took a look at
the register to find out who had occupied the room
next to his—the one through which the desperate rascal
had made good his retreat from the fire-escape.</p>

<p>The name on the register was “Anton Mescal, Fair
Play, Col.”</p>

<p>“Fair Play!” muttered Hodge, who was looking
over Frank’s shoulder. “What does a scoundrel like
that know of fair play?”</p>

<p>Frank asked the clerk if he could give a description
of Mescal.</p>

<p>“He is slender, looks like a Spaniard, and has a
small, pointed, black mustache,” was the answer. “I
do not remember how he was dressed, so his clothes
must have been fairly within the style.”</p>

<p>“That’s the man!” exclaimed Hodge. “I saw his
face, and the description fits.”</p>

<p>Frank nodded.</p>

<p>“I believe Mescal is the man,” he said. “I will give
one thousand dollars for his capture and the restoration
to me of the document which he snatched from
my hands.”</p>

<p>The clerk looked at Merry, as if doubting his ability
to pay such a sum; but the young Yale graduate was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
taking a small roll of bills from his pocket. From the
roll he drew off two five-hundred-dollar bills, which
he handed to the cashier, who stood near the clerk.</p>

<p>“The money is to be paid to the person or persons
who capture or cause to be captured the thief who
stole the document from me, in case it is restored to
my hands,” said Merriwell quietly. “You are to enlist
the services of the regular police and do everything
in your power.”</p>

<p>“The police have been called already,” said the
clerk. “I telephoned the nearest station immediately,
and two officers appeared very shortly. They have
been guarding the entrances to the hotel, while the
regular house detectives have been searching. I suspected
this Mescal and gave an accurate description
of him to the policemen. They have not stopped him
as yet.”</p>

<p>“Only two officers on guard!” exclaimed Frank.
“Yet there is a front and back entrance, and one
through your barber’s shop and by the way of the
bar. Mr. Mescal is out of the hotel by this time.”</p>

<p>“We have done everything we could” declared the
clerk.</p>

<p>Frank turned away.</p>

<p>“The message is lost, Bart,” he said.</p>

<p>“Lost?” said Bart, astonished that Frank should
give up so easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“Yes,” Merry nodded, his face wearing a grim expression.</p>

<p>Hodge was trembling with rage at the outcome.</p>

<p>“It’s an infernal shame!” he hissed. “Merriwell,
you must——”</p>

<p>Frank’s hand gripped his arm.</p>

<p>“Come!” said Merry’s voice, still calm and restrained.</p>

<p>Together they went to the nearest police-station,
where Frank told his story to the sergeant in charge,
repeating his offer for the arrest of the thief and
the restoration of the message. He was told that
everything possible should be done, and with that
promise he was compelled to be satisfied.</p>

<p>Frank scarcely spoke as they returned to the hotel.
Bart wiped the perspiration from his face and said
things to himself.</p>

<p>In his room Merry sat quite still for some time,
the look on his face indicating that he was in deep
thought.</p>

<p>Bart did not venture to break in upon his meditations.
To Hodge this second loss of the message, at
the moment when Merry had begun to read it, was
something to throw him into a perfect tempest of
rage; but Frank had shown that he was master of his
temper.</p>

<p>Bart knew Merry was thoughtfully considering the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
situation and studying over it in view of the proper
course to pursue. After half an hour he quietly
said:</p>

<p>“That is what I’ll do.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Bart, unable to repress his
curiosity longer. “What have you decided to do?”</p>

<p>“I believe there is not one chance in a thousand
that the man who snatched that message will be captured
before he can get out of New York, and this
has led me to decide on a course of action. In the
single sentence that I read my father said that he
was at the cabin of Juan Delores, near Urmiston,
which is about fifty miles from Denver. I shall wait
here until to-morrow. If the police have not made a
capture by that time, I shall leave New York.”</p>

<p>“Whither bound?”</p>

<p>“For the cabin of Juan Delores, near Urmiston,
Colorado. I am going to find out the truth, if possible.
There is a mystery to be solved, and I mean to
solve it. Bart!”</p>

<p>“Frank!”</p>

<p>“Are you with me?”</p>

<p>Merry had risen. Hodge leaped to his feet. Their
hands met, as Bart exclaimed:</p>

<p>“To the end, through thick and thin!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br>

<small>THE OLD INDIAN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Before them lay the mighty Rockies, rising range
on range, till their glittering, snow-capped summits
pressed the sky. Wild and picturesque and awe-inspiring
was the scene. They were in the foot-hills, and
the country was rough and broken.</p>

<p>Frank had drawn rein at the mouth of what seemed
to be a small valley. He was covered with dust,
and the hardy mustang he bestrode showed signs of
weariness.</p>

<p>Merriwell was clothed to rough it, having exchanged
the garments of the cities and towns for those more
suited to the latter stages of his search for the cabin
of Juan Delores. On his head was a wide-brimmed
felt hat, and he wore a woolen shirt, with a side collar
and a flowing tie, a cartridge-belt about his waist,
and leather leggings covered his trousers nearly to his
thighs. There were spurs on the heels of his boots.
His coat he had stripped off, for the day was warm
to an uncomfortable degree.</p>

<p>A Winchester repeating rifle was slung at the pommel
of Merry’s saddle, and a pair of long-barreled
revolvers rested in the holsters on his hips. Taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
altogether, he looked like a young man who had made
preparations for almost anything he might encounter.</p>

<p>Bart Hodge, similarly mounted and dressed, had
drawn up beside Frank.</p>

<p>Despite their attire, there was something in the appearance
of the two young men that marked them as
belonging to “the tenderfoot breed.” In other words,
the experienced eye would have discovered at a glance
that they were Easterners.</p>

<p>A cool breeze came down the valley, bearing with
it a pleasant odor of wild growing things.</p>

<p>The faces of both lads, lately fresh from college,
had been burned and blistered by the hot suns and searing
winds.</p>

<p>“It’s remarkable,” said Frank, “that the people at
Urmiston know Delores, know he lives somewhere
in this vicinity, yet not one of them could give us accurate
directions to reach his cabin.”</p>

<p>“Hanged remarkable!” growled Bart. “This is the
third day we have spent in hunting for his old place,
and we’ve not even found a clue to it.”</p>

<p>Merry nodded, frowning beneath the wide brim of
his hat.</p>

<p>“We may have passed and repassed it,” he said.
“There are plenty of places where cabins could be
hidden in these valleys.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. What are we to do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“Keep on hunting.”</p>

<p>“It’s rather tiresome.”</p>

<p>“I shall stick to it till I find the cabin of Delores,
if it takes a year!” exclaimed Frank grimly.</p>

<p>Bart knew he would do exactly as he said.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we may be disappointed when we do
find it.”</p>

<p>“At least, I should be able to learn if my father is
dead, and where he is buried.”</p>

<p>“But the message——”</p>

<p>“I have hopes that I may learn the secret of that,
also. It may be that he did not trust it alone to that
one document.”</p>

<p>“It’s getting late. What are we to do now? Shall
we explore this valley to-night, or wait till morning?”</p>

<p>Little of the valley could be seen through the
narrow pass, and that little seemed to promise that it
led onward far into the hills. After a moment Frank
answered:</p>

<p>“We’ll ride forward and see if we can get a look
into it.”</p>

<p>He started onward, and Bart followed, but they
had proceeded only a short distance when they were
startled to see, sitting on a boulder at one side of
the pass, a strange figure. At first it was hard to
make out whether it was man or woman, but, as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
drew nearer, it straightened up and revealed, peering
from the folds of a dirty red blanket, the wrinkled
and gnarled face of an old Indian. A pair of beady
black eyes were steadily regarding the two young
men.</p>

<p>“Watch him, Merry,” cautioned Bart, in a low tone.
“These half-civilized red dogs are treacherous.”</p>

<p>The Indian did not stir as they approached. Beside
him, leaning against the boulder, was a handsome
rifle. He did not touch the weapon.</p>

<p>“Hello, chief,” said Frank, addressing the old man
in a manner he knew was flattering to some redskins,
as he drew up.</p>

<p>“How, how,” grunted the old fellow, in answer.</p>

<p>“Are you acquainted in this vicinity?”</p>

<p>“Ak-waint?” said the old man. “No savvy.”</p>

<p>“Are you familiar with the country?”</p>

<p>“Fam-mil? What him?”</p>

<p>“Have you been all round every place here?” asked
Merry, with a sweep of his arm, using the simplest
words he could command.</p>

<p>“Heap been all over,” was the assurance.</p>

<p>“Know Juan Delores?”</p>

<p>“Him don’t live round here.”</p>

<p>The answer was prompt enough—a trifle too
prompt, Frank fancied.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t?” said Merry. “Where does he live?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Heap long way off there,” and the redskin pointed
to the north.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Heap sure.”</p>

<p>“How far? How many miles?”</p>

<p>“Two time ten.”</p>

<p>“Twenty?”</p>

<p>The old fellow grunted an affirmative.</p>

<p>“Do you know the way to his place?”</p>

<p>Another affirmative grunt.</p>

<p>“Can you guide us there?”</p>

<p>“No time.”</p>

<p>“We will pay you well.”</p>

<p>“No time.”</p>

<p>“I will give you fifty dollars to guide us to the cabin
of Juan Delores.”</p>

<p>“No time.”</p>

<p>“A hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“No time.”</p>

<p>“Confound him!” growled Hodge angrily. “Money
is no object to him. It’s likely he doesn’t know the
value of money. Now, if you had a quart of whisky
to offer him, Merriwell, you might get him to do the
job.”</p>

<p>“I will give you a new blanket and a rifle,” promised
Merry.</p>

<p>“Got blanket an’ rifle,” said the old Indian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“I will give you a good horse.”</p>

<p>“Got heap good horse.”</p>

<p>“What haven’t you got that you want?”</p>

<p>“No want nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell us how to get to the cabin of Delores?”</p>

<p>“Go there two time ten mile, find stream, go up
him to spring, take trail from spring; it make you
come to where Juan he live.”</p>

<p>Merriwell was not at all satisfied with these directions.
There was something in the manner of the old
redskin that seemed to arouse his suspicions and make
him feel that he was being deceived. Of a sudden
Frank asked:</p>

<p>“Who lives in this valley?”</p>

<p>The old man shook his head.</p>

<p>“No know,” he said. “Wolf, bear, mebbe.”</p>

<p>“That’s not what I mean. Is there a white man
who lives in this valley?”</p>

<p>Again a shake of the head.</p>

<p>“Wolf, bear, that all. No; big mount’n-lion—him
there. Him kill hunter—one, two, t’ree, four hunter—what
come for him. Him vely bad lion—heap
bad.”</p>

<p>Frank was watching the man closely.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’m looking for!” he exclaimed,
as if delighted. “I want to shoot a mountain-lion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“You no can shoot him. Big hunter try—no do
it. Him kill you heap quick, you go in there.”</p>

<p>“He is trying to frighten us so we’ll not go into
the valley,” thought Frank. Aloud he said:</p>

<p>“That’s all right; I’ll take chances. I reckon the
two of us will be too much for Mr. Lion.”</p>

<p>“White boy much foolish,” declared the old redskin
grimly. “Make big supper for lion. Lion him
like white man for supper.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll have the pelt of that lion just as sure as
I live,” said Merry, as if in sudden determination.
“Come on, Bart!”</p>

<p>The old Indian rose quickly as they were about to
start forward.</p>

<p>“Stop!” he cried. “Ole Joe Crowfoot him tell
you truth. If you go in there you never come back
some more. Ole Joe Crowfoot him good Injun—him
like white man heap much. No want to see um hurt.
Tell um to stay back.”</p>

<p>The old savage seemed deeply in earnest now, but
that earnestness was something that added to Frank’s
suspicions and made him all the more determined to
go on.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Merry, with a grim smile.
“It’s kind of you to take so much interest in us, but
we’re going after your heap bad lion, and we’ll have
his pelt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Night come soon,” said the Indian, with a motion
toward the range on range of mountains rising to the
westward. “Then lion him crouch and spring. Him
git you quick.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see. If you wait round here long enough
we’ll show you the pelt of your bad lion when we
come back.”</p>

<p>“No come back,” declared Old Joe Crowfoot, solemnly.
“No see you some more. By-by.”</p>

<p>An expression of deep sadness and regret was on his
wrinkled old face as he uttered the words. Merry
laughed lightly, and they rode past him and headed
onward into the valley.</p>

<p>“He was very anxious to stop us,” said Hodge.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” nodded Frank. “He was altogether
too anxious. As soon as I tumbled to that I decided to
take a look into the valley. Do you know, we stumbled
on the entrance to this valley by accident. I fancy
we might search a week for it, if we were to go away
now, without finding it.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of that,” said Bart. “It might
puzzle us to find it again. Perhaps that old duffer
was counting on that. Those red dogs are treacherous,
and——”</p>

<p>They heard a sharp cry behind them. Whirling in
the saddle, Frank saw the old Indian standing with
the butt of his rifle pressed against his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>The muzzle on the rifle was turned directly toward
Frank, and plainly the redskin was on the point of
pressing the trigger.</p>

<p>Frank knew he was in deadly peril, and he would
have attempted to fling himself from the saddle but
for something else he saw.</p>

<p>On a mass of jagged rocks behind the Indian and
about twenty feet above his head had appeared a boy.
Not over thirteen years of age was the lad, whose
curly, dark hair fell upon his shoulders. He was
dressed in fanciful garments, like those worn by a
young Mexican lad, and the bright colors of his
clothes made him a picturesque figure.</p>

<p>Plainly it was from his lips that the cry had issued.</p>

<p>In his hand the boy held a stone as large as a man’s
fist, and even as Merry turned he hurled the stone.
Straight through the air whizzed the missile, striking
the barrel of the old Indian’s rifle.</p>

<p>Smoke belched from the muzzle of the weapon and
the crags flung back the sound of the report, but the
bullet flew wild.</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell’s life had been saved by the stone
thrown by the strange boy.</p>

<p>With an exclamation of rage, Hodge snatched up
his rifle and reined his mount round to take a shot at
the redskin, who had wheeled instantly and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
clambering up the rocks toward the boy, as if bent on
murder.</p>

<p>“Soak him, Merry!” panted Bart.</p>

<p>Frank’s first impulse was to shoot, but he quickly
saw that he was in no further danger just then, and
he had no desire to shed human blood unless compelled
to do so.</p>

<p>Bart’s rifle rose, but Merry thrust the muzzle aside
just as the weapon spoke, and the bullet flattened on
the rocks.</p>

<p>“Why did you do that?” roared Hodge, in amazement
and anger. “Can’t you see! That red devil is
going to murder the kid!”</p>

<p>It did seem that the Indian meant the boy harm, and
Merry shouted:</p>

<p>“If you put a hand on that boy I’ll bore you!”</p>

<p>At the same time he held his own rifle ready for instant
use.</p>

<p>Old Joe Crowfoot seemed either not to hear or to
be too enraged to heed. Like a mountain-goat, he
raced upward over the rocks and hastened straight toward
the boy. But, what was strangest of all, the boy
made no effort to escape, nor did he seem at all frightened.
Instead, he seemed to stand and await the approach
of the Indian.</p>

<p>Frank and Bart were surprised by this, but they
were still more surprised by what followed. The Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
reached the boy and quickly clutched him. Then,
with a swift swing, the strange old redskin swept the
lad round behind him and up to his back. The arms of
the boy immediately clasped about the Indian’s neck,
while his legs twined round the old fellow’s body, and
there he hung pickapack fashion.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Old Joe Crowfoot paused in his upward
race. When Frank and Bart had confronted
him at the mouth of the valley both had fancied him
old and rather feeble, but now he seemed to have the
strength of a youth and the agility of a mountain-goat.
Having swung the boy to his back, he continued to
clamber upward over the rocks as if quite unimpeded
by his burden.</p>

<p>“Well,” gasped Hodge, “if that doesn’t beat the old
boy himself!”</p>

<p>Merry was no less amazed. To both it had seemed
that the old Indian meditated doing the boy harm as he
clambered toward him, but the youngster had betrayed
no fear, although his hand flung the missile that destroyed
Old Joe’s aim and saved Frank Merriwell’s
life.</p>

<p>“He’s running off with the boy!” palpitated Bart.</p>

<p>“And the boy is perfectly willing,” said Merry.</p>

<p>“But the kid threw the stone at the old duffer.”</p>

<p>“For which I am very thankful, as it is certain the
old duffer meant to perforate me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>Then they sat there on their horses and watched till
the old Indian and his remarkable burden disappeared
amid the rocks. Just before vanishing from view, Old
Joe Crowfoot paused, turned and looked down on the
boys. Then he made a gesture that seemed to be one
of warning. The boy, still clinging to the back of his
peculiar companion, took off his wide hat and waved it
gaily. A moment later they were gone.</p>

<p>Frank and Bart sat there, staring upward and remaining
silent for some moments. At last Merriwell
said:</p>

<p>“Well, that little affair is over. Let’s move along
and see what will happen next.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand it,” muttered Hodge, in disappointed
perplexity.</p>

<p>“Nor do I,” confessed Frank cheerfully.</p>

<p>“It’s strange.”</p>

<p>“Mighty strange.”</p>

<p>“A white boy and an Indian.”</p>

<p>“Companions beyond a doubt.”</p>

<p>“Yet the boy threw a stone at the Indian.”</p>

<p>“I believe he threw the stone to hit the Indian’s
rifle, a feat he accomplished. I do not think he intended
to hit the Indian. Anyhow, I owe him my life,
and I am grateful.”</p>

<p>For a few minutes longer they remained there, discussing
what had happened, and then Merry again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
led the way into the valley. As they advanced it slowly
broadened before them. The valley was eight or ten
miles in length, and a stream ran through it, disappearing
into a narrow gorge. Near the head of the
valley was a pretty little lake, with timber about it.
In the valley were to be seen a few grazing cattle, yet
from their position the boys could see no ranch-house.</p>

<p>“But I’m certain somebody lives here,” said Frank.
“The sight of the cattle convinces me of that.”</p>

<p>They soon found that it was no easy matter to ride
down into the valley from that point, but they discovered
a dimly defined trail, which they ventured to
follow. Fortunately the hardy little mustangs were
steady and sure of foot, for there were points where
it seemed that no horse could go down without falling.</p>

<p>The little beasts squatted on their haunches more
than once and literally slid along till they could recover
themselves.</p>

<p>Bart had his teeth set, and no word came from his
lips, as he was ready and determined to follow wherever
Merriwell led. No accident happened, and the
level of the valley was reached. Then they headed
toward the lake at the upper end.</p>

<p>The sun was dropping behind the western peaks
when they entered a strip of timber that lay across
their path in the vicinity of the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>The cattle they had passed gave them little notice,
convincing them that they were accustomed to the
presence and sight of mounted riders. The timber was
open, yet they were unable to ride through it at a
swift pace, as they had not entered on a regular trail.
When they had proceeded a considerable distance they
came at last upon a path. In the deepening gloom it
was not easy to make out if it was a horse-trail or a
foot-path.</p>

<p>As they reached this path, Frank suddenly pulled
up, uttering a soft word of warning.</p>

<p>“Stop, Hodge!” he said. “I thought I heard something.”</p>

<p>Bart stopped promptly, and they sat there, motionless
and listening. At first they heard no sound save
the breathing of their mounts. Bart was about to
speak, when Merry lifted his hand.</p>

<p>Straining their ears, they distinctly made out the
sound of swift footsteps, which were approaching.
Hodge gripped the butt of a revolver and drew it from
its holster. A moment later the silence of the gloomy
timber was broken by a sound that sent the blood leaping
to their hearts.</p>

<p>“Help! Oh, oh—help!”</p>

<p>It was the cry of a child in great fear and distress.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br>

<small>THE KIDNAPED GIRL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Choke off the kid, Bill! Are you crazy, to let her
screech like that?”</p>

<p>The command came quick and sharp and suppressed.</p>

<p>“Hanged ef I like this yar business of chokin’
babbys! I wouldn’t mind ef she wuz a man.”</p>

<p>The retort was growled forth in a gruff bass voice.
Two dark forms were seen coming along the path.
One of them, the one in advance, carried in his arms
a little girl of twelve.</p>

<p>The ruffians did not observe Frank and Bart until
they were quite close. Then, of a sudden, as the big
fellow in advance halted, uttering a startled oath,
Merriwell’s clear voice rang out:</p>

<p>“Drop that child, you whelps, or we’ll drop you.”</p>

<p>The man behind made a quick movement, and Frank
flung himself from the saddle. It was well Merry did
so, for the man had whipped out a revolver and fired
over the shoulder of his companion, the bullet whistling
past Frank’s ear as he dropped.</p>

<p>“Got him!” grated the man, evidently believing he
had shot the youth. “Down goes the other one!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>Bart had a revolver in his grasp, but, in the gloom
of the timber, he had refrained from firing, fearing to
injure the girl, who now uttered another cry for help.</p>

<p>But Hodge knew he was in danger, and he feared
Frank had been hit by the shot of the ruffian. He
ducked beside the neck of his horse and was barely in
time to save his life, for another flash of fire punctured
the shadows, another report rang through the
timber, and the second bullet cut a hole through the hat
of the dark-faced youth.</p>

<p>Then Hodge saw Merriwell leaping straight at the
ruffian in advance, and he knew Frank was not seriously
hurt. With a shout of relief and satisfaction,
Bart sprang to the ground and jumped after Frank.</p>

<p>“Give it to the dogs, Merry!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Merriwell was on the big ruffian in a moment. The
man had swung the child under his arms, and he
brought forth a revolver as Frank came up.</p>

<p>The young athlete ducked and struck out, and the
revolver was sent spinning from the grasp of the
wretch, being discharged as it flew through the air.</p>

<p>Then Merry was on the scoundrel and the ruffian
was forced to drop the child and meet the attack of the
fearless youth.</p>

<p>Hodge went past like a leaping panther, but the
other man had darted behind a tree and melted away
amid the underbrush in a most surprising manner, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
while Bart slashed about in search of the fellow who
had disappeared, Merriwell fought the other, who was
a gigantic man of remarkable strength.</p>

<p>The child had crept away a short distance, where it
crouched on the ground, watching the battle in fascination
and fear.</p>

<p>“Dern yer!” growled the ruffian. “Whatever do ye
mean by botherin’ two peaceable gents in this yar
way?”</p>

<p>“We mean business,” answered Frank.</p>

<p>“Waal, danged ef I don’t cut yer inter ribbons!” declared
the giant, as he made a movement and wrenched
forth a knife.</p>

<p>Frank moved swiftly, and was barely in time to
fasten his fingers on the wrist of the murderous
wretch.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” he exclaimed. “I object to anything
of the sort!”</p>

<p>“Object and be dished!” came from the other.
“Why, do you think yer kin hold that yar hand? Ye’re
nothin’ but a kid!”</p>

<p>Then the ruffian made a furious, wrenching twist
to get his hand free, but, to his surprise, the grip of
the beardless youth was like steel, and he failed utterly
in his attempt.</p>

<p>This was the fellow’s first surprise; others followed
swiftly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“What’s this?” he howled, in fury. “Dang my
hoofs! kin you hang on that way?”</p>

<p>“You’ll find I’m something of a sticker,” laughed
Frank.</p>

<p>Now, the other did not know that when Frank Merriwell
laughed in that peculiar manner he was the most
dangerous, and he fancied the youth thought the affair
not at all serious.</p>

<p>“I’ll git him in a minute,” the ruffian mentally decided,
“an’ I’ll give him the length of this yar toad-sticker,
which’ll convince him that this is a mighty sad
world, I reckon.”</p>

<p>But though he made another furious attempt to get
his hand free, the fingers of the youth were like riveted
bands. Then the ruffian grew still more angry.</p>

<p>“Double dern yer!” he panted. “You kin hang on,
so I reckon I’ll just have ter break yer back!”</p>

<p>Then he tried to fling Frank to the ground, but
Merry used a wrestling-trip, and the man went down
instead. In the fall the grip of the youth was almost
broken, and, with a snarl of satisfaction, the ruffian
twisted his wrist free.</p>

<p>Then he swung back his hand to drive that terrible
knife to the hilt between Merry’s ribs. But Frank
knew his danger, and, like a flash, he had the thick,
hairy wrist again in his clutch.</p>

<p>The man swore and tried to fling his youthful antagonist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
off, but he found he could not do so and retain
his hold on the knife. Then he relinquished the
knife and put every effort into the struggle to hurl
Merry aside.</p>

<p>The little girl, on her knees by the foot of a great
tree, watched this fearful battle with distended eyes.</p>

<p>Bart Hodge was still beating about for the man
who had so cleverly vanished in the gloom. There was
a sudden report, as fire belched from a tangled thicket,
and a bullet grazed Bart’s cheek.</p>

<p>Hodge dropped, knowing now the other man had
sought shelter, and waited till he felt that he could
bring one of the youths down with a sure shot. Evidently
the man believed he had succeeded, for he rose
to his feet, so that Bart obtained a glimpse of him.</p>

<p>In his impatient rage, Hodge did not wait for the
fellow to advance, but he took a quick aim and fired
immediately. Down went the man.</p>

<p>“Soaked him!” said Bart grimly. “He brought it
on himself.”</p>

<p>Then he lifted himself to his feet. It was Bart’s
turn to meet with surprise, for again from the thicket
came a flash of fire, and this time Hodge felt something
burn and sting in his shoulder.</p>

<p>With a shout of fury, Hodge leaped straight toward
the thicket, into which he fearlessly plunged,
reckless of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>But when he reached the spot where he believed the
enemy must be, he found no one there. The desperado
had slipped away as Hodge came leaping toward the
spot, being aided to escape by the deepening darkness.</p>

<p>Finding the man was not there, the conviction came
on Hodge that he was crouching near, waiting to obtain
another shot, which he would take care to make
sure. Then the instinct of self-preservation overcame
Bart’s great fury, and he crouched close to the ground,
holding his revolver ready, while he peered about in
the gloom and listened.</p>

<p>Not far away the battle between Frank and the
giant ruffian was still raging fiercely.</p>

<p>With every sense on the alert, Bart squatted there,
ready to shoot or spring. His nerves were tingling,
but he did his best to be steady and cool. An encounter
of this sort, however, was something to unsteady the
nerves of almost any man, and it was not at all strange
that Bart found himself shaking somewhat as he remained
motionless and waiting.</p>

<p>The breathing of the floundering giant who was trying
to conquer Merriwell sounded hoarsely through
the gloom, and there was something awesome in it.
Suddenly the sounds stopped. The struggle seemed to
be ended. Who had conquered?</p>

<p>At the risk of betraying his position to the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
who might be waiting to shoot at him, Bart ventured
to call:</p>

<p>“Merriwell!”</p>

<p>Hodge’s heart gave a leap of joy when Frank’s
voice answered:</p>

<p>“Here! Are you all right?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing! And you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve succeeded in quieting this chap, though
he did put up an awful fight.”</p>

<p>“Look out for the other!”</p>

<p>“Then he is——”</p>

<p>“He’s around here somewhere. I popped at him
two or three times, but I didn’t bag him.”</p>

<p>Crouching low, Bart moved as quietly as he could
toward Frank, still ready to shoot instantly. But in
the gloom no pistol flashed, and no deadly bullet sang
through the timber.</p>

<p>Bart found Merriwell with his arm about the frightened
child, while near-by, on the ground, lay the body
of the giant, sprawling grotesquely.</p>

<p>“Have you killed him?” asked Hodge, looking down
at the silent ruffian.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Afraid?” exclaimed the dark-faced youth.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why afraid?”</p>

<p>“I have no desire to kill anybody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“But this murderous dog——”</p>

<p>“Not even a human being of his caliber.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Hodge grimly, “I did my level best to
bore the other cur, and my conscience would not have
troubled me had I succeeded. How did you do this
one?”</p>

<p>“He had wonderful strength and wind, and he
thrashed round to beat the band. I was forced to be
at my best all the time, and I hurled him back repeatedly
after he had partly succeeded in rising with
me. The last time I did so his head struck against
the exposed root of that tree, and it doubled under him
with a snap like a pistol-shot. Then he was limp as
a rag, and the fight was over, so far as he was concerned.”</p>

<p>Bart caught the ruffian by the shoulders and partly
lifted him. Then he let the fellow drop back, a slight
shiver running over him.</p>

<p>“Neck broken!” he said shortly.</p>

<p>“Broken!” exclaimed Frank. “As bad as that?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing!” said Hodge. “He won’t try to kidnap
any more children, for I reckon that was what
they were doing with this one.”</p>

<p>Frank turned his attention to the child once more,
while Bart looked after the tired mustangs. As he
approached the animals, a figure suddenly sprang out
of the gloom and onto the back of one of them. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
was a yell, and away dashed the animal along the path,
bearing the ruffian who had escaped.</p>

<p>Hodge took a shot at the fellow, and then, finding
the man still clung to the mustang, having disappeared
in the gloom, he fired again in the direction of the
sound. Still the mustang fled on with its burden, and
Bart muttered an exclamation of rage.</p>

<p>The other animal had been alarmed by this, and Bart
found some trouble in approaching the creature,
though he finally succeeded in capturing him.</p>

<p>“Well, Merriwell,” he said, as he returned, leading
the single mount, “we’ve lost one of our beasts.”</p>

<p>Frank had been trying to allay the fears of the
trembling child, and he simply made a gesture for Bart
to be quiet, which was seen and understood, for all of
the fast-deepening shadows.</p>

<p>“We will not harm you,” Merry was saying, in a
soft, gentle way. “You need have no further fear.
What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Felicia,” was the low answer. “But Old Joe calls
me Star Eyes.”</p>

<p>“Felicia—what a pretty name!” said Frank. “And
these bad men were carrying you off?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Please take me home.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do that, little Felicia. Your home is here, in
the valley?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Yes, sir. It’s in the Black Woods, by Lake Sunshine.”</p>

<p>“Lake Sunshine? Another pretty name! What do
you call the valley?”</p>

<p>“Pleasant Valley.”</p>

<p>“And that is a pretty name, too.”</p>

<p>“My mama named the lake, and the valley, and the
woods. But now she’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Gone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and papa says she’s gone to a beautifuler
world than this, though it doesn’t seem to me it can
be true, and I know just where papa put her in the
ground when she died. I was there putting flowers
on her grave, and the grave of the Good Stranger,
when those bad men grabbed me and carried me
away.”</p>

<p>Frank felt a queer thrill.</p>

<p>“The Good Stranger?” he said. “Who was that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I loved him, and Dick loved him, and we all
loved him, for he was so kind. But the fever took
him, and he died, too. He is buried near my
mama.”</p>

<p>“What was his name?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Old Joe called him White Beard,
but I just called him uncle.”</p>

<p>“How long ago was it that he died?”</p>

<p>“More than a week, now. Papa buried him, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>Bart’s hand fell on the shoulder of Frank, who was
kneeling, with one arm about the little girl. That
touch told that Hodge was beginning to realize just
what Merry’s questions were leading to, which filled
him with eagerness.</p>

<p>“What is your papa’s name?” asked Merry, and then
held his breath as he waited for the answer.</p>

<p>“I just call him papa,” said the child. “Please take
me to him. He will be so sorry when he finds I’m not
at home.”</p>

<p>“In a moment we’ll take you to him. You call him
papa, but what do others call him?”</p>

<p>“Nobody ever comes here much, except Old Joe, and
he calls my papa Silent Tongue.”</p>

<p>“Who is Old Joe?”</p>

<p>“A good Indian.”</p>

<p>Merry started a bit, and then quickly asked:</p>

<p>“Do you mean Old Joe Crowfoot?”</p>

<p>“Papa calls him Crowfoot sometimes. Please take
me to my papa.”</p>

<p>“The scent grows hot!” muttered Hodge.</p>

<p>“And did you never hear your father called anything
but Silent Tongue? What did your mother call
him?”</p>

<p>“Most times she called him dearest, but sometimes
she called him——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“Yes, yes—she called him what?”</p>

<p>“Juan.”</p>

<p>“I knew it!” broke from Hodge. “We’re on the
right trail, Merry!”</p>

<p>“At last!” exclaimed Frank, in deep satisfaction.
“Little Felicia, we’ll take you to your father without
delay.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br>

<small>JUAN DELORES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>They left the big ruffian lying there in the darkness
of the timber. Little Felicia was placed on the back of
the mustang, beside which Frank walked, while Bart
led the way along the path.</p>

<p>Having passed from the dark timber, they came out
near the pretty little lake, which was reflecting the
golden glory of the lingering sunset, flung up against
the mountain-bordered sky. The crimson and amber
and purple were fading from the heavens as the somber
wing of night spread over the world.</p>

<p>“There are the Black Woods,” said the little girl,
as she indicated a thick mass of trees near the head of
the valley. “My home is in there.”</p>

<p>By the dying light Frank made out that she was
very pretty, with dark hair and eyes. She had a sweet
voice.</p>

<p>“Felicia,” he thought, as they made their way toward
the woods. “The name seems to fit her. It
seems strange to find such a child here.”</p>

<p>Merry was restraining the impatience that beset him,
for now he felt that he was near the end of his long
search. He had no doubt that the Good Stranger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
spoken of by the child was his father, who had died
there in that wild but beautiful spot—died as he had
lived, strangely.</p>

<p>There was a mystery to be unfolded, and Frank was
determined to clear it up, if possible.</p>

<p>“Up there,” said Felicia, with a gesture, “is the
place where my mama and the Good Stranger are
buried.”</p>

<p>Frank was near the grave of his father, he believed.
It was too late to visit it then; besides, Merry felt that
it was his duty to take the child home without delay.
Felicia had explained that her father was away at the
time when the men came upon her and carried her
away, having left some hours before, saying he would
return ere nightfall, and warning her to stay close to
her cabin home.</p>

<p>As they approached the Black Woods they could
discern the dark opening where the trail entered.
There the track was plain beneath their feet. But when
they were yet a little distance from the woods a stern
voice cried from the darkness of the shadows:</p>

<p>“Halt, dere!”</p>

<p>Bart stopped, his hand flying to the butt of his revolver.
His rifle, swinging from the saddle of his
mustang, had been lost when the escaping ruffian rode
madly away on the beast.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to draw da gun!” came the voice from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the woods. “Shoot mighty quick if you do! Up with
da hands!”</p>

<p>“It’s papa!” exclaimed little Felicia. “Papa! papa!”</p>

<p>Bart shrugged his shoulders and lifted his hands.</p>

<p>“T’other one put up da hands,” came the voice.</p>

<p>“We are friends,” declared Frank quietly. “We
have just saved your child from the hands of ruffians.”</p>

<p>“Put up da hands!” ordered the voice, and there
was a clicking that seemed to tell of a rifle being
cocked. “I’ll shoot if you don’t!”</p>

<p>Merry stood up boldly, facing the point from which
the voice came, fearlessly saying:</p>

<p>“If you shoot, you will fire on those who have saved
your child, which will prove you a dastard. I refuse
to be held up road-agent style, and shall not lift my
hands. Fire if you will!”</p>

<p>Silence for a moment, and then, quick as thought,
the child leaned over and put her arms about Merry’s
neck, crying:</p>

<p>“Don’t, papa—don’t! He beat the big, bad man who
was carrying me away!”</p>

<p>Another silence, and then the voice called:</p>

<p>“Felicia!”</p>

<p>“Papa!”</p>

<p>“Get off dat horse and come here quick-a!”</p>

<p>She seemed to hesitate, and then she tightened her
arms about Frank’s neck, murmuring in his ear:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“Don’t be afraid. I’ll not let my papa hurt you.”</p>

<p>A second later she had slipped to the ground and
was running toward the dark woods, into which she
disappeared.</p>

<p>Frank and Bart stood waiting what was to follow.
The sound of murmuring voices came from amid the
grim old trees, and the child was heard relating to her
father the story of her thrilling and exciting adventures.
But it seemed that the man meditated upon
the proper course to pursue, for she was forced to plead
with him in behalf of Frank and Bart.</p>

<p>“They are good, papa—I know they are,” they
heard her declare. “The one who fought so hard for
me with the great, big, bad man is just as kind and
gentle.”</p>

<p>After a time the man came forth from the darkness,
leading the child by the hand, while he carried
his rifle in his other hand. He seemed to be keenly
on the alert, as if he did not trust the strangers, for all
of the words of his child.</p>

<p>“I have to t’ank you,” he said, with an accent, “for
what you have done. My little Felicia, she tell me.
She is all I have left now. When I come on my way
home and hear da shooting, my heart it jump like a
frog into my mouth-a. I run home quick as I can, and
call, call, call for her. She do not answer. Den I
t’ink somet’ing have happen to her, and I start to run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
dis way fast. When I come here to da edge of da
woods I see you coming dis way, and I stop. You
bring my little Felicia back-a to me, and I t’ank
you.”</p>

<p>The child seemed to look at her father in surprise,
as if she were not accustomed to hearing him speak
thus freely.</p>

<p>“We are happy to be of service to you and little
Felicia, Mr. Delores,” said Merry quietly.</p>

<p>The man was seen to start a bit, while he gripped
his rifle still harder.</p>

<p>“You know my name?” he said, a bit harshly.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“We have come far to find you.”</p>

<p>This seemed to put him more than ever on his
guard.</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“The story is rather long,” said Merry. “There is
no chance for us to get out of this valley to-night.
Take us to your home and I will tell you everything.
I do not think you will regret it.”</p>

<p>“Why should I do dat? You are strangers.”</p>

<p>“That is true, but you knew Charles Merriwell.”</p>

<p>Frank looked straight and hard at the man as he
uttered the words, but, to his surprise, the father of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
little Felicia did not betray emotion of any sort—or
the darkness hid his betrayal.</p>

<p>“Charles Merriwell?” he said. “Who you mean?”</p>

<p>“The Good Stranger, who lies buried over yonder.”</p>

<p>“What you know ’bout him?”</p>

<p>“He was my father.”</p>

<p>Little Felicia gave a cry, but the man simply said:</p>

<p>“How you prove dat?”</p>

<p>“I can prove it. I am Frank Merriwell, well known
in New Haven, where I have been at college. This is
my friend Bart Hodge, who will tell you whatever you
wish to know about me.”</p>

<p>“But I know not’ing of him. Dat be no proof.
Have you de word?”</p>

<p>“The word?”</p>

<p>“Dat’s what I ask.”</p>

<p>Frank was forced to confess that he did not know
what Juan Delores meant by “the word.”</p>

<p>“Den you be not Frank Merriwell!” positively declared
the man.</p>

<p>“I do not know what you mean by ‘the word.’”
Merry said, “but I assure you that you are wrong
about me not being Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“He would come with da word.”</p>

<p>“Then you have been expecting him?”</p>

<p>“I no say so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“But you have the same as said so. There has been
a failure of the plans, Mr. Delores, and that is why I
do not come with the word you expect. I will explain
everything to you if you will give me a chance.”</p>

<p>“Why should I trust-a you?”</p>

<p>“Your daughter, safe at your side, answers that
question.”</p>

<p>“Follow me,” said Juan Delores, turning about.</p>

<p>Frank had won, and he followed, Bart striding along
at his side, saying nothing, but thinking a great deal.
They entered the Black Woods by the dark trail, which
it was now difficult to follow, proceeding till they came
to a cabin in the very midst of the growth. No light
gleamed from the cabin, but Delores said:</p>

<p>“Dis my home. Felicia, you take da stranger in da
house and make da light. I take da horse. I come
prit’ quick.”</p>

<p>Frank surrendered the mustang to the man, and
then they followed little Felicia into the cabin, wondering
why the home had been built in the midst of
that gloomy growth of trees.</p>

<p>The child found matches and lighted an oil-lamp
which stood on a table in the living-room—the room
they had entered. The light showed them a comfortably,
even tastily, furnished room, much to their surprise.
It was small, but the walls were tinted blue, the
floor carpeted, and the furniture was good. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
were handsome paintings on the walls, while at the two
windows were lace curtains. A handsome piano stood
in one corner of the room, opposite an open fireplace
of stone.</p>

<p>Both Bart and Frank were surprised, and they exchanged
glances which told each other their feelings.</p>

<p>By the light of the lamp, Merry saw that little
Felicia was pretty, indeed, with a dark, oval face, and
snowy white teeth.</p>

<p>“Let me take your hats,” she said, smiling at them.
“Sit down. Papa will be right in.”</p>

<p>They sat down, and Merry, finding a guitar, soon
occupied himself. Having tightened the strings and
put the instrument in tune, he strummed lightly upon
it, singing a soft little song to the girl, who came and
stood near, her hands clasped, looking at him earnestly.</p>

<p>While Merry was singing, Juan Delores came to the
door and paused a moment. He looked in and beheld
the spectacle. It reassured him and banished his fears.
When he came in he closed and bolted the door.</p>

<p>“I see you make yorse’f at home,” he said. “Good!”</p>

<p>He was a man with a Spanish face and deep, dark
eyes. His face was not exactly handsome, and yet
about it there was something fascinating. He had a
mustache and imperial, which had once been coal-black,
but were now heavily mixed with gray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>Delores had studied Merriwell’s face as he stood
outside the door, and what he saw seemed to restore
his confidence. Surely, this frank-appearing youth
who was singing to Felicia could not be very bad.</p>

<p>But, when he looked at Bart, Delores was not so
sure, for the face of Hodge was not one so easily
read.</p>

<p>Felicia clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s a fine song!” she cried.</p>

<p>“You like music, do you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do! I can sing.”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to hear you sing.”</p>

<p>“Mama taught me,” said the little girl soberly.
“She used to sing such sweet songs.”</p>

<p>Juan Delores had very little to say, though he lingered
a while and listened to their talk. At last he
said:</p>

<p>“I see you all right, young gentlemen. I go get da
supper. Mebbe you be hungry?”</p>

<p>“Well,” smiled Frank, “to confess the truth, I am
ravenous.”</p>

<p>“And I’m rather empty myself,” acknowledged Bart
dryly.</p>

<p>“I have not much fine food,” said Delores; “but I
t’ink I have somet’ing to fill you on.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’re looking for, Mr. Delores,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Merry. “You’ll not be troubled by our fastidiousness.”</p>

<p>“Can I help you, papa?” asked little Felicia.</p>

<p>“No; you stay and make da gentlemen company.”</p>

<p>Then, having stood quite still and looked at Merry,
the queer man suddenly held out his hand, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“I t’ank you, sir, for save my little girl. I love
her. She is all I have left since her mother go ’way
forever.”</p>

<p>Frank was touched.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, Delores,” he said, as he took the
offered hand. “Her cry of distress appealed to me, and
I was ready to fight to the death for her.”</p>

<p>“I know da men who were carryin’ her off,” said
Felicia’s father, his eyes flashing. “Da come here an’
make da threat when da no find what da want. I go
to look for dem, but I did not t’ink da get dis side of
me. I t’ink my Felicia be safe.”</p>

<p>Then he stooped and put his arms lovingly about
the little girl, whom he kissed with great tenderness.</p>

<p>“You knew the men?” said Merry. “What did they
want?”</p>

<p>“Somet’ing da never get,” answered Delores. “Da
big one be Gunnison Bill, da worst dog in da State!”</p>

<p>“That’s the one I had the fight with,” nodded Merry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“With him? Why, he much bigger dan you!”</p>

<p>“Somewhat.”</p>

<p>“How you fight him?”</p>

<p>“Hand to hand. He pulled a knife on me, but I got
him by the wrist and forced him to drop it.”</p>

<p>Delores seemed unable to believe this.</p>

<p>“Why, you very young!” he said. “You almost
boy. Gunnison Bill, he is giant.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell is an athlete,” put in Hodge. “He
is the champion all-round athlete of Yale—or was.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell!” said Delores, again looking
searchingly at Frank. “Why you call him dat?”</p>

<p>“Because it is his name, even though you, for some
unknown reason, seem to think contrary.”</p>

<p>Juan Delores shook his head.</p>

<p>“It is very queer,” he said. “If he be Frank Merriwell,
he should bring da word.”</p>

<p>“I think I know what you mean by that,” said
Merry. “‘The word’ is something my father told you
I would be able to give when I appeared. I will explain
after supper why I am unable to give the word.
I believe I can satisfy you, sir.”</p>

<p>“I hope you do dat; but never till you give da word
am I to do it.”</p>

<p>“Do what?”</p>

<p>“Dat I shall not tell.”</p>

<p>“It is plain that you are bound not to betray your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
trust, Mr. Delores, whatever it is. I admire you because
you are faithful.”</p>

<p>“An’ I admire you because you whip da Gunnison
Bill. How you do it I cannot guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, he did fight so hard, and I was so
afraid!” exclaimed Felicia. “Once I thought sure the
bad man would kill him right before me, but I prayed
to the Lord.”</p>

<p>“Did you pray?” breathed Frank, drawing her to
his knee. “Bless you, sweet little Felicia! Perhaps
it was your prayer that saved my life!”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p>“It may be. Who knows?”</p>

<p>“<i>Quien sabe</i>,” said Juan Delores. “But it was not
Gunnison Bill dat be most dangerous. It was da odder.
I know him—I know Anton Mescal!”</p>

<p>“Anton Mescal?” shouted Frank, leaping to his
feet and clutching the man’s arm. “Good heavens!
do you mean to tell me that the man with Gunnison
Bill was Anton Mescal?”</p>

<p>“Dat his name. He come here an’ try to bluff me
two days ago. I laugh at him. He swear he make
me laugh some odder way. He try to keep his word.”</p>

<p>“Anton Mescal!” repeated Merry, in deep emotion.
“And it was too dark for me to recognize the wretch
who stole the message from me! Oh, if I had grappled
with him, instead of Gunnison Bill!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Oh, if I had bored him with a bullet!” grated
Hodge, who was even more excited than Merry.</p>

<p>“You know him?” questioned Delores.</p>

<p>“Know him?” said Frank. “I never saw the
scoundrel but once in my life, but on that occasion he
snatched from my hands the dying message sent me
by my father, who, I believe, is buried in this valley.”</p>

<p>Delores could not help being impressed by the words
and manner of the two young men.</p>

<p>“Dat why Anton Mescal come here an’ make him
demand,” he said. “But he never succeed. Da boy is
safe.”</p>

<small>DELORES UNMASKS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The suspicions of Juan Delores were allayed at last,
and he left the boys with Felicia, while he retired to
an adjoining room to prepare the supper. Frank and
Bart were given something to talk about.</p>

<p>“Mescal is near,” said Merry. “He may have that
message on his person. If fate will only bring us face
to face once more!”</p>

<p>“If fate had directed one of my bullets!” exclaimed
Hodge. “What do you suppose that message contains?”</p>

<p>“You have asked me a question to which I cannot
imagine the answer.”</p>

<p>“Your father was very rich.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And peculiar.”</p>

<p>“True.”</p>

<p>“Where is his wealth?”</p>

<p>“Heaven knows.”</p>

<p>“Where is his will?”</p>

<p>“Give it up.”</p>

<p>“That message must have told where to find his
wealth and the will he has left.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“Perhaps so. But something tells me that was not
all. I am certain the message held something more—a
secret of great importance.”</p>

<p>“Mescal is a desperate scoundrel. He will not be
driven away easily.”</p>

<p>“I hope not.”</p>

<p>Felicia came and climbed on Frank’s knee once
more.</p>

<p>“You have had trouble,” she said, in her tender,
sympathetic way. “Your papa is dead. Was the Good
Stranger your papa?”</p>

<p>“I think so, little one,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“He was kind to me,” said she; “but he loved Dick
most.”</p>

<p>“Dick—who is Dick?”</p>

<p>“Dick is my cousin. He lives here.”</p>

<p>“Here? Why, I have not seen him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! He is away now.”</p>

<p>“Away where?”</p>

<p>“He has gone with Old Joe. Once before he went
away with Old Joe, and was gone a whole month.
But I miss him so much, for I love him.”</p>

<p>“Is his name Dick Delores?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. All I ever called him was just
Dick. Oh, but he can shoot and ride, and Joe is teaching
him everything he knows.”</p>

<p>“How old is Dick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“One year older than I am.”</p>

<p>“The boy we saw with the old Indian!” exclaimed
Bart.</p>

<p>“The boy who saved my life!” said Merry, who then
told Felicia what had happened at the entrance to the
valley.</p>

<p>“That was Dick!” she cried, “and that was Old Joe!
But why did Old Joe want to shoot at you?” she
speculated, her face clouding. “He is papa’s friend.”</p>

<p>“He must have thought me your father’s enemy,”
spoke Frank.</p>

<p>“He must,” nodded Felicia gravely. “Old Joe
would not wish to shoot a friend.”</p>

<p>“The mystery of the Indian and the boy is solved,”
said Merry.</p>

<p>“Still, it’s rather singular,” muttered Bart. “Why
should Delores let the boy go with that old savage?”</p>

<p>“Papa sent Dick away with Old Joe,” put in Felicia.</p>

<p>“Sent him away?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I think he was afraid the bad
men would carry Dick off, same as they tried to carry
me.”</p>

<p>Frank’s face showed that he was thinking deeply.</p>

<p>“Why should they carry Dick off?” he asked himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
“It must be that there is treasure buried near
here, and they are seeking to wring it from Delores.
But the man took extra precautions to protect the boy,
while he did not seem to fear for the safety of his
own child, as he left her entirely alone. There is much
about this affair that is not clear to me.”</p>

<p>Then Delores appeared at the door and announced
that supper was ready. They went back to the dining-room,
Merry carrying little Felicia in his arms.</p>

<p>The room was quite as pretty as the living-room.
In the center stood the table, covered by a clean, white
cloth, with the dishes and food upon it. A sideboard
had been built in the wall. The chairs were of the
rustic variety, plainly also the handiwork of Delores.
The cook-room, in an ell-like part of the cabin, was
shut off from view by a swinging spring-door.</p>

<p>“Welcome,” said Delores.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” bowed Frank. “Your hospitality is
appreciated, you may be sure.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Bart, as his eyes ran over the
table. “Don’t believe I was ever hungrier.”</p>

<p>They sat down, Delores at the head, with Felicia
opposite. Frank and Bart sat on the opposite sides of
the table. When they were seated, the little girl placed
her soft white hands together, bowed her head, and
said “grace” in a simple, touching way.</p>

<p>Then, when the “amen” had risen from the lips of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
the three men at the table, Delores lifted the cover of
a platter and revealed to view some broiled steak, the
sight of which made Bart Hodge positively ravenous.</p>

<p>That supper was enjoyed by all. Delores smiled
when he realized how hungry his visitors were, and
he was pleased to see them satisfy the cravings of their
appetites.</p>

<p>Merry sought to satisfy Delores that he was no impostor;
but the man was on his guard, and it was not
easy to tell what thoughts were passing through his
mind. Then Frank told of the adventures at the entrance
to the valley, relating how the old Indian had
tried to frighten them from entering, and had declared
that Juan Delores lived far away to the north.</p>

<p>“He faithful old fellow!” exclaimed Delores.
“Once, long time ago, he come here very sick—just
able to crawl to door. My wife, she take him in an’
doctor him; she get him well, though he have da fever.
He never forget. He do anyt’ing for us.”</p>

<p>“Even to commit murder,” said Hodge. “He would
have shot one or both of us if the boy had not hurled
a rock and struck the barrel of his rifle.”</p>

<p>Felicia clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“Dick can throw a rock just as straight!” she exclaimed.
“Oh, he can do lots of things, and Old Joe
has promised to teach him all the things he knows
about the mountains, the prairies, and the woods.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“His education is well begun,” said Frank, “but it
is the finishing off that will count.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he can read and write and all dat!” quickly
exclaimed Juan. “My wife, she be educated American,
and she teach Dick and Felicia.”</p>

<p>The laughter passed swiftly from the face of the
girl, and she sadly said:</p>

<p>“Yes, mama used to teach us every day, but Dick
was so hard to teach—he was so wild. Now mama is
gone, and I have tried to teach myself; but Dick will
not study at all.”</p>

<p>Frank felt like asking Delores some questions about
the mysterious boy with the old Indian, but, feeling
that he had no right to do so, he refrained. It seemed
that Delores felt like explaining a part of the mystery,
which led him to volunteer:</p>

<p>“Anton Mescal, he come after Dick. Dat why I
let Old Joe take da boy. Old Joe protec’ him.”</p>

<p>“Then it is Dick, not Felicia, that Mescal wants?”</p>

<p>Delores nodded.</p>

<p>“If you have da word, you would know dat,” he declared.</p>

<p>And then it was that Merriwell began to feel that
there was some strange, invisible link that connected
himself with this wild boy of the mountains.</p>

<p>Delores had talked far more than usual with him,
and he suddenly showed a disposition to close up like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
a clam. Merry fancied it must be because he thought
the conversation was getting on dangerous ground,
and this caused Frank to lead it in another direction.</p>

<p>“How did you happen to settle here in this out-of-the-way
place, Mr. Delores?” he asked. “Why did
you build your home here in this thick piece of
woods?”</p>

<p>“Hard to see it here,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Then you did not wish it seen?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“And that was why you selected this valley, which
might be passed and repassed without finding a good
way of descending into it?”</p>

<p>Delores nodded.</p>

<p>“It is a good place for a man who chooses the life
of a hermit,” said Bart, “but one is out of the world
here.”</p>

<p>“Dat not true,” said Juan. “Dis is God’s world
here! Da mountain, da blue sky, da wild flower, da
sweet air, da birds—it is God’s world.”</p>

<p>“It is beautiful!” murmured Felicia.</p>

<p>“But monotonous!” muttered Bart.</p>

<p>“Some men cannot choose,” said Juan. “I was one
of dat kind. I have to make my home where I can
be safe.”</p>

<p>“That’s different,” said Frank.</p>

<p>Somehow, Delores seemed to fancy that both visitors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
looked on him with suspicion after that speech, and
he hastened to add:</p>

<p>“I do no crime—no. I do not’ing in this country to
make me hide-a.”</p>

<p>They looked at him in silence. Somehow, that
seemed to sting him deeply, for he suddenly burst
forth:</p>

<p>“If you knew! I have kep’ da secret long—I have
kep’ da silence. Now Mescal, he know all ’bout it.
How he find it out I do not know; but he will tell it
everywhere. Da secret will be no longer one. Soon
I shall have to go ’way from dis valley. I have
t’ought dat some time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa—oh, no, no, no!” cried Felicia, springing
from her place and running round to him. “Go
away from here? Leave my dear mama out there all
alone? Oh, no, no, no!”</p>

<p>Her distress was great, and the tears appeared in
her deep, dark eyes. He caught her up and kissed
her hair, holding her close to him.</p>

<p>“My little Felicia!” he said huskily. “I ’fraid da
time come when we must go; but, some time, mebbe,
we come back to put da sweet flower on mama’s
grave.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why should we go, papa?”</p>

<p>“Papa have great many enemy. Now da bad man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
know him here da enemy may find out soon. Papa
go ’way, so him not be hurt.”</p>

<p>“Your cattle—what will you do with them?” asked
Frank. “I suppose those are your cattle in the valley?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dem mine. I know way to drive dem out. I
sell dem.”</p>

<p>But still little Felicia was greatly distressed over the
thought of going away and leaving her home. She
knew no other home, and that one was very dear to
her.</p>

<p>“Must we go, papa?” she sobbed. “Must we go?”</p>

<p>“I am ’fraid of dat,” he nodded. “We find some
place else to live.”</p>

<p>Again he saw the visitors looking at him curiously.</p>

<p>“You t’ink I do somet’ing wrong?” he cried. “I
do not’ing but fight for liberty. I make enemies dat
swear to kill me if da follow me to da hot place. At
first I feel no fear of dem. Den da gov’ment pronounce
me outlaw—put da price on me! I have to
fly from my country. My enemy follow. I have to
fight for my life. I kill one, two, t’ree. Dat make
dem worse. All da relation swear to find me an’
take my head to da gov’ment. I find myself hunted
man night an’ day. Den, at last, when I marry beautiful
American wife, for her sake I have to find place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
where we can live quiet. Den I come here, and we
live here happy together.”</p>

<p>It was an interesting and tragic story, and Merry
did not doubt its truth. So this man, Juan Delores
as he called himself, had been married to an American
woman, who was the mother of Felicia.</p>

<p>Delores looked from one to the other of his visitors.</p>

<p>“You believe me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Frank, while Bart bowed.</p>

<p>“I tell you who I am,” said the man. “Perhap’ you
have heard ’bout me.”</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and stood there before them,
looking proudly at them. There was in his pose now
the manner of the born aristocrat. He smiled a little.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he said, “I am da Don Jose Maria
Queypo de Llano Ruiz y de Saravia, of Spain!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br>

<small>THE MESSAGE RECOVERED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Frank had heard of him, a Spanish refugee and outcast,
a man of noble family, who had sacrificed himself
and his fortune for what he firmly believed was
right and justice.</p>

<p>“Count De Saravia!” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the man.</p>

<p>Then he told them much of his story, and Felicia,
who had known nothing of it herself, sat and listened
in wondering silence. But what the count told did not
clear up the mystery that puzzled Frank.</p>

<p>After the supper was over, they returned to the living-room,
where Merry opened the piano and played.
Little Felicia sang for them, and finally she crept into
her father’s arms and fell asleep. He carried her off
to bed, and Merry and Bart turned and faced each
other.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Hodge.</p>

<p>“Strange,” said Merry. “But the haze remains as
deep as ever.”</p>

<p>“Deeper, if anything.”</p>

<p>“I feel like getting some air,” said Frank.</p>

<p>Hodge would have accompanied him when he rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
to go out, but instinct told Bart that Merry chose to
be alone.</p>

<p>Frank passed along the deep wood path till he came
to the open. The moon had risen in the east, and was
shedding its silver radiance into Pleasant Valley. The
little lake lay with a shimmering path of silver moonshine
across it.</p>

<p>The scene was calm and peaceful enough. Frank
stood on the edge of the shadowy woods and gazed
upon the quiet valley. From far, far away came the
cry of some prowling wild beast, but that was the only
sound to break the calm of the peaceful night.</p>

<p>“She said the graves were up this way,” Frank murmured.
“I will see if I can find them.”</p>

<p>After a time he came upon them. They were not
far apart, with a great tree rising near at hand. One
had a granite stone at its head, and on the stone had
been crudely chiseled the name “Lucy.”</p>

<p>Frank knew that was the grave of Felicia’s mother.
The other grave had been lately made, and no stone
rose above it.</p>

<p>“My father rests here!” murmured Frank, as he
knelt beside that mound.</p>

<p>For some minutes he remained there, tears starting
from his eyes and trickling slowly down his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Poor father!” came softly from his lips. “You
never knew what real peace and happiness meant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Yours was a wild, strange life, and it seems fitting that
you should die as you did. But, oh, what would I
not have given to have been at your side! Perhaps I
could have comforted you. To-morrow I will bring
flowers and place upon this mound. A stone shall be
erected, and here, dear father, you will sleep your long,
last sleep. At last you have found the peace and rest
that was denied you in life. God knows what is best,
and He doeth all things well.”</p>

<p>When he turned away he felt in no mood to return
to the cabin at once, so he wandered down toward the
shimmering lake, which seemed calling to him in the
soft whispers of passing breezes. As he approached
the lake, he passed beneath some wide-spreading trees,
which gave a deep shadow.</p>

<p>Suddenly his attention was attracted by a moving object
on the bosom of the lake. He paused and gazed,
and the moonlight showed to him a canoe that seemed
to be occupied by two persons. It was approaching
the side of the lake on which Merry stood, and he could
see the dripping paddle flash and shine in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Not a sound came from the canoe. There was no
movement of either figure, save the swinging arms
of the one in the stern, who plied the paddle.</p>

<p>Merriwell drew a little nearer to the shore, shielding
himself carefully and waiting. When the canoe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
was close in, he decided that it must contain the old
Indian, Joe Crowfoot, and the strange boy.</p>

<p>Barely had the craft touched the shore when out
from places of concealment leaped two men and flung
themselves on the Indian and the boy. One of the
men clutched the boy, who fought like a tiger-cat.</p>

<p>The other ruffian gave his attention to the old Indian,
who whipped out a knife and met his attack.
The man fired a shot, but the Indian closed in swiftly,
as if not touched, and this forced the assailant to drop
his revolver and bring forth a knife.</p>

<p>Then a deadly and terrible battle took place there on
the shore of Lake Sunshine. The knives were heard
to strike and grate together as the foes met, hand to
hand and face to face.</p>

<p>It fascinated Merriwell, and, for the instant, he
paused to stare at the spectacle. He saw the Indian’s
assailant was almost a giant, and a startling thought
flashed through his mind:</p>

<p>“It’s Gunnison Bill! I did not kill him, after all!”</p>

<p>“Now, redskin, I’m goin’ ter carve yer up! I’ll just
rip yer inter ribbons in a minute!”</p>

<p>The voice was that of the big ruffian, and then
Merry knew beyond a doubt that the man was Gunnison
Bill.</p>

<p>A cry came from the lips of the boy, arousing Frank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
from the strange lethargy that seemed to have seized
him. Without a sound, the young athlete leaped toward
the spot where the boy was doing his best in the
struggle with the man who had clutched him.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll take a hand here!” exclaimed Merry, as
he sprang upon the man.</p>

<p>It was the companion of Gunnison Bill, who had
escaped on Frank’s mustang.</p>

<p>Startled by Merry’s sudden appearance, the fellow
whirled about, trying to fling the boy aside. The
moonlight fell full on his face.</p>

<p>“Anton Mescal!” cried Merriwell exultantly. “At
last I have found you!”</p>

<p>“Frank Merriwell!” gasped Mescal, for it was the
scoundrel who had snatched the message from Merry
in the New York hotel.</p>

<p>“Yes!” shouted Merry, as he fastened his hands
upon the fellow. “I believed fate would bring us together
here! Now I shall recover the message you
stole from me!”</p>

<p>“Never! You’ll have to kill me first!”</p>

<p>“Then I shall kill you!” came the cold, hard words
from Frank’s lips.</p>

<p>“Bill! Bill!” cried Mescal. “Help, Bill!”</p>

<p>“Bill is having his hands full,” said Merry. “Old
Joe Crowfoot is attending to him.”</p>

<p>“He can kill that old dog in a minute!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“Perhaps, but Old Joe may get in a few licks while
he is doing it.”</p>

<p>A fierce struggle between Frank and Mescal ensued.
Mescal was no match for the young athlete, but he felt
that he was fighting for all that he desired and held
dear, so he put up a stiff struggle for a while. At last
Merry forced the fellow to his knees, fastening a
clutch on his throat.</p>

<p>“Give up?”</p>

<p>“Curse you—no!” hoarsely breathed Mescal.</p>

<p>Merry’s fingers shut off the man’s wind, and it
seemed that the bones cracked beneath that pressure.
Still the desperado fought to the last, though he
gradually grew weaker and weaker.</p>

<p>Merry choked the man into insensibility. Having
done this, he began to search his clothes for the message.
In course of time he found it, within an inner
pocket. Frank opened it and looked at it by the aid of
the moonlight.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” he said. “I have it again! This
is the message my father wrote and sent to me.”</p>

<p>He had been so absorbed that he was quite unaware
of anything else that was taking place. Now, having
thrust the message into his pocket, he rose and looked
around.</p>

<p>To his amazement, the canoe, containing the old
Indian and the boy, was gliding swiftly away over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
lake, while on the shore lay the bleeding body of Gunnison
Bill. In the knife duel the ruffian had met more
than his match in Old Joe, who had ended the career
of the desperado. Gunnison Bill’s life of evil-doing
was over.</p>

<p>Frank called to the Indian and the boy, urging them
to return, saying he was a friend; but they paid not the
least heed, and the canoe kept on till it melted into the
shadow along a distant shore.</p>

<p>Anton Mescal lay quite still on the shore, and Frank
feared he had killed the fellow. On kneeling by the
side of the scoundrel and feeling for his heart-beats,
Merry found that life remained in Mescal’s body.</p>

<p>“He’ll recover,” Merry decided. “I think I’ll truss
him up.”</p>

<p>So he lifted Mescal and carried him up the bank
to a large tree. The unconscious villain was placed
in a sitting position on the ground, with his back
against the tree, after which Merry stripped up the
man’s coat and bound him in that position.</p>

<p>Having disposed of Mescal thus, Frank hastened
back toward the cabin home of Delores. On the way
he met Hodge.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard a shot,” said Bart. “Didn’t
know but you were in trouble, and that brought me
out hot-foot.”</p>

<p>Hodge was ready for anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“You did hear a shot,” said Frank. “It was fired
by Gunnison Bill.”</p>

<p>“Gunnison Bill? Why, he’s dead!”</p>

<p>“You are right; he is dead now; but we did not
leave him dead in the timber over yonder, as we
fancied.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t? What has happened, Merry? Tell me
as quick as you can.”</p>

<p>But Bart could scarcely believe the story Frank had
to tell.</p>

<p>“You met Mescal there?” he exclaimed joyously;
“and you have the message?”</p>

<p>“Safe in my pocket,” said Frank. “I shall read it
to-night.”</p>

<p>“I told Delores I would go out and see what the
shot meant. He remained to guard Felicia. Let’s
return and let him know there is no danger.”</p>

<p>So they went to the cabin, where they found Delores
waiting, rifle in hand, for anything that might
occur. When he heard Merry’s story he was even
more excited than Bart.</p>

<p>“Mescal out there?” he panted. “Dat man must
not git away! Take me to dat man! He know my
secret, an’ he be my enemy!”</p>

<p>It was not without serious misgivings that Merry
led the way to the spot where the struggle had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
place on the shore of the lake. He found an opportunity
to whisper to Bart:</p>

<p>“Watch him! We can’t stand by and see him murder
Mescal, no matter what Mescal may have done.”</p>

<p>But when they came to the tree where Frank had
bound Mescal, they found the man had recovered,
broken his bonds, and escaped.</p>

<p>Delores was like a hound on the scent, and he followed
the trail till it ran into a piece of timber, where
it was lost for the time.</p>

<p>“But I’ll take it up in da morning!” declared the
refugee. “He must make da fast track if he get
away.”</p>

<p>The body of Gunnison Bill they buried that night
not far from where he fell.</p>

<p>And then, with Bart in the room where they were
to sleep, Frank Merriwell brought forth and read
the strange and startling message sent him by his
dying father.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br>

<small>WHAT THE MESSAGE CONTAINED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>That message gave Merriwell the greatest surprise
of his life, for it told how Charles Conrad Merriwell,
Frank’s father, after his first wife’s death, had
married another woman, whom he met in the West.
And it told how, by his second wife, Mr. Merriwell
had had one son, Richard, who was thus a half-brother
to Frank. But Mr. Merriwell had been hunted
by his bitter enemy, Dion Santenel, and never had
his life been anything but one of trouble and fear.
It was not such a life as would make a wife happy
and contented. Fearing Santenel might find his wife
and strike him, through her, Mr. Merriwell had hidden
her away in a safe retreat. But she was frail and
delicate, and she had not survived.</p>

<p>The second Mrs. Merriwell was a sister to the wife
of the man known as Juan Delores, and so to Juan
Charles Merriwell took the motherless boy, Richard.
Juan had raised Richard there in that hidden valley
as if the boy were his own son, and there he had been
happy and contented, with Felicia, his cousin, for his
only playmate.</p>

<p>When fate had brought Charles Merriwell and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
first son together once more, the lips of the man remained
sealed concerning a portion of his life. Thus
it happened that Frank Merriwell had never suspected
the existence of a half-brother.</p>

<p>But, when the end came, Charles Merriwell summoned
strength to write a full confession. As he
wrote it, he knew he had been followed about by
men who sought to wrest from him in some manner
his great fortune, or a portion of it, and it was his
fear that they might succeed after he was dead.</p>

<p>He sent Delores to Denver for a reliable messenger
to take the precious document to Frank. The messenger
employed was a detective belonging to an
agency in the city, and he executed his trust faithfully,
for all that Anton Mescal, aware of his purpose, followed
him all the way to the Atlantic coast, seeking to
get possession of the precious document in the oilskin
envelope.</p>

<p>In the confession Charles Merriwell charged his
son Frank to take care of Richard, bring him up
properly, be both brother and father to him.</p>

<p>“He is a frail lad in some ways,” wrote the dying
man, “and he should be trained and built up until he
possesses a marvelous physique, like your own, Frank.
I give him into your hands for this task. He is your
brother, and I charge you to make a man of him—such
a man as you yourself have become. I am proud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
of you, Frank, for you are a son to make any father
proud. Dick is like you in some ways, but he is
unlike you in many. He is wild, impulsive, passionate,
and hard to govern; but I believe you can mold him
into a splendid man.</p>

<p>“You know I am rich, and I leave all my wealth
to be divided between you and Richard, in case you
carry out my instructions faithfully. The will, which
Juan Delores will give to you when you come to him
with the word, will make everything clear. He will
also turn over into your care your brother, Richard.
I think there is no danger but you will be faithful to
this duty I have left you, but, should you fail to take
charge of Richard and care for him, you will see by
the will that you are cut off from ever receiving a
dollar of my wealth.”</p>

<p>Frank felt a twinge of pain as he read this.</p>

<p>“Why did he have to write that?” he thought regretfully.
“Ah! he did not know me well, or he would
have been certain I would do everything in my power
to carry out his instructions.”</p>

<p>Later on in the message was given “the word”
which Frank was to speak to Delores.</p>

<p>Hodge had seen enough to know how deeply Frank
was touched, and he retired as quietly as possible,
leaving Merry sitting there reading that astonishing
revelation over and over again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>The night was far spent before Frank lay down to
sleep. His slumber was filled with dreams, and more
than once he murmured:</p>

<p>“Richard—Richard, my brother!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the morning Frank spoke “the word” to Juan
Delores, saying:</p>

<p>“I have recovered the message that was stolen from
me by Anton Mescal, and I have read it over and
over. I wish to see my brother.”</p>

<p>Delores bowed.</p>

<p>“You shall see him soon,” he promised.</p>

<p>Then he went away somewhere, and, after a time,
returned with the last will and testament of Charles
Conrad Merriwell, which he placed in the hands of
Frank.</p>

<p>“I was convinced last night,” he said, “dat it
b’long to you; but I had to swear to your father dat
I never give it to any one who fail to bring da word.
What could I do? I did not know. I t’ink I find
some way to let you know da word after you give me
all da proof dat you be Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“You have been faithful and true, Mr. Delores,”
said Merry, with a hand on the shoulder of the man.
“I shall not forget. A Merriwell never forgets.”</p>

<p>“Dat all right,” asserted Juan, flushing. “But had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
we foun’ Mescal last night, I t’ink I would feel better
now.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe Mescal will trouble any of us
again,” said Frank. “It was his object to keep me
from finding out what I was to do, so that I would
not comply with the terms of the will. If I failed
to take care of my brother, I was to have no part in
the property left by my father. A false Richard might
have been substituted, and there are a dozen schemes
whereby Mescal could have profited had he succeeded,
but he failed utterly, and now he will have to
look out for himself.”</p>

<p>At this moment Felicia, laughing gaily, appeared at
the open door of the cabin, calling:</p>

<p>“Oh, Frank, come out!”</p>

<p>Merry had told her on the previous evening that
she was to call him Frank.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” smiled Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Come and see,” she urged. “I have a surprise for
you. Oh, come quick!”</p>

<p>Laughing, he complied. She grasped him by the
hand and led him round the cabin.</p>

<p>There, standing where the morning sunshine fell
through an opening in the Black Woods, were two
persons, an old and wrinkled Indian and a bright-faced,
dark-eyed boy.</p>

<p>Frank was face to face with his brother.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br>

<small>A REBELLIOUS SPIRIT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Hee-haw! hee-haw! hee-haw!”</p>

<p>Rattle-ty-smash! rattle-ty-thump! thump! smash!
thud!</p>

<p>“Hee-haw! hee-haw! hee-haw!”</p>

<p>“Oh, ha! ha! ha! ha! Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>Pandemonium seemed to have suddenly broken
loose just outside the window at which Frank was
writing.</p>

<p>The braying hee-haw was followed by such a smashing,
and crashing, and banging that it brought Merry
to his feet immediately.</p>

<p>Then came a burst of wild, elfish boy laughter.</p>

<p>“What the dickens is he up to now?” exclaimed
Frank, as he sprang to the window and looked out.</p>

<p>The sight that met his eyes was both amusing and
surprising. To the tail of a small, long-eared burro,
attached by means of a cord, hung an old tin can.
And the burro was hee-hawing and kicking furiously
in a mad endeavor to free himself from the thing
which clattered and thumped about his heels.</p>

<p>On the ground, in a perfect paroxysm of delight,
rolled Dick, from whose lips came the shrieks of elfish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
laughter. It was two days since Frank had first met
this, until then, unknown half-brother.</p>

<p>Wrapped in a dirty red blanket, sitting with his
back against the wall of the cabin, was Old Joe Crowfoot,
who calmly smoked his long-stemmed pipe, and
regarded the youngster and the burro with the gravity
of a stone image.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! oh, dear!” shouted the boy. “Look at
Billy! Kick it again, Billy! Oh, ha! ha! ha! Oh,
ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>Billy kicked and rolled his eyes round at the persistent
thing that came banging back against his heels.
There was a comical look of mingled terror and anger
in the eyes of the little burro. He plunged and leaped
about in various attempts to get away from the rattling
pail, which his heels had battered out of all semblance
to its original shape.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted the old Indian, and he gravely
continued smoking, without moving hand or foot.</p>

<p>Then came a sudden, childish cry of distress, and
round the cabin Felicia came running. She rushed
straight toward the little burro.</p>

<p>“Oh, Billy! Billy!” she cried. “Who hurt my Billy?
Stop, Billy! I’ll take it off!”</p>

<p>Heedless of danger, fearless of the flying hoofs and
plunging beast, she ran right up to the burro. A
moment later she was knocked flat as the little animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
lunged round in its mad struggles to get away from
the banging pail.</p>

<p>A leap carried Frank Merriwell out through the
open window, and it seemed that another spring took
him to the side of the child, which he caught up in his
arms.</p>

<p>At the same moment the string broke and the
burro sent the old can whizzing into the branches of
a tree near at hand. Twice after this the heels of the
excited little beast twinkled in the air, and then, seeming
to realize that he had conquered at last, he let
forth a triumphant bray.</p>

<p>The boy sprang up and stood quite still, all the
laughter gone from his face.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Felicia?” asked Merry, as he held
the girl in his strong arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” she sobbed. “But my Billy is hurt!
Put me down—please put me down!”</p>

<p>Frank did so, and she ran to the burro, clasping it
round the neck and sobbing as she showered the now
quiet little creature with caresses.</p>

<p>Still the old Indian remained motionless by the
cabin wall, not even pulling a bit quicker at the pipe
to betray that he had been disturbed or interested by
what had happened.</p>

<p>Frank turned to the boy.</p>

<p>“Did you do it, Dick?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“Do what?” said the boy, with a defiant air.</p>

<p>“Hitch that thing to Billy’s tail.”</p>

<p>“Yes; what if I did?”</p>

<p>Without retort to this, Merry again gave his attention
to the girl, who was continuing to bestow caresses
on the burro.</p>

<p>“Billy is not hurt, Felicia,” he said gently. “Don’t
cry any more. Are you sure he didn’t hurt you when
he knocked you down?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” was her assurance. “Just here some,”
pressing her hand to her side. “And here a little.”</p>

<p>But when he pushed back her sleeve he found her
arm was bruised and bleeding slightly.</p>

<p>At this moment, having been attracted by the
rumpus, Juan Delores, the father of little Felicia,
came hastily upon the scene. He was a man of few
words, and it seemed that past experience must have
told him who was to blame for what had happened,
as he gave the dark-eyed boy a quick look, then lifted
the child and carried her into the house.</p>

<p>“Dick,” said Frank, to the boy, “I have something
to say to you.”</p>

<p>Again the lad gave him a defiant look, but did not
speak.</p>

<p>“Come into the house,” said Merry, as he started
toward the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>The boy did not stir. On the steps Merry turned
and looked straight at the rebellious youngster.</p>

<p>“Dick!”</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and they stood thus for some moments,
looking at each other.</p>

<p>“Come in!” said Frank, still keeping his eyes fastened
on those of the boy.</p>

<p>It seemed that the lad was struggling to resist, but
that, in spite of his desire to do otherwise, his power
was not sufficient to combat that of the young man
on the steps. Slowly at first, as if seeking to hang
back, he advanced, and then he followed Frank into
the cabin.</p>

<p>In a back room little Felicia could be heard sobbing,
her father speaking an occasional kind word to
her.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Dick,” said Frank, pointing to a chair.</p>

<p>The boy hesitated, as if on the point of refusing,
and then sat down, as directed.</p>

<p>Frank went to his chair at the table near the window.
As he did so he glanced out through the window
and saw the old Indian in exactly the same position
as before, only it seemed he had moved a little nearer
the window, as if he wished to hear what passed within
that room.</p>

<p>Merry sat down, took up his pen, dipped it in the
ink, and quietly finished the sentence he had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
writing when he was interrupted by the rumpus outside
the window. The boy fidgeted nervously.</p>

<p>The sobbing of little Felicia gradually ceased in
the back room; her father was heard to tell her that
she was all right, and a few moments later she came
running round the corner of the cabin, having passed
out by the back door. She hastened straight to the
burro, which she again hugged, and caressed, and
kissed, calling the docile little beast all sorts of pet
names.</p>

<p>All at once the boy jumped up from his chair, crying:</p>

<p>“If you’re going to say anything to me, say it! I’m
tired of sitting here, and I won’t sit here any longer!”</p>

<p>Frank looked up, but Dick turned his eyes on the
floor.</p>

<p>“Look at me,” Merry commanded.</p>

<p>“I won’t!” was the answer.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, and then Frank repeated:</p>

<p>“Look at me!”</p>

<p>Slowly those dark eyes were lifted till they met
Frank’s steady gaze. The boy caught his breath and
stood quite still until Frank quietly said:</p>

<p>“Please sit down a moment longer, Dick, till I reach
a place where I can stop conveniently.”</p>

<p>The words were not a command, but they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
spoken as if Frank had no thought in the world that
they would meet with a refusal; and, without waiting
to note their effect, Merry resumed writing.</p>

<p>The boy sat down and remained quiet till Merriwell
laid aside the pen, smiling.</p>

<p>“Come here, Dick,” said Frank.</p>

<p>The boy rose and came to him.</p>

<p>Frank turned his head to look out of the window,
which led the boy to look in the same direction, and
he saw little Felicia still caressing the burro.</p>

<p>“You didn’t know Felicia cared so much for Billy,
did you, Dick?” asked Merry, smiling a bit.</p>

<p>The boy did not answer.</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t,” Frank went on; “and it’s
very foolish of her. It’s silly to care so much for a
homely little donkey, and she ought to be punished
for it.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t silly!” burst forth the boy warmly, his face
flushing; “and she hadn’t ought to be punished!”</p>

<p>“Do you really think so?” asked Merry, elevating
his eyebrows slightly, and appearing surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so!” was the defiant answer.</p>

<p>“And you knew she cared so much for Billy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew it.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be possible! Why, I thought you loved
Felicia, your cousin!”</p>

<p>“I do!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“Oh, I can’t believe it, Dick—really I can’t!”</p>

<p>“I do! I do!” cried the boy passionately. “Don’t
you dare say I don’t!”</p>

<p>“But you like to give her pain?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t!”</p>

<p>“Strange! You have done so often within the
past two days. You have done about everything you
could think of that she would not like you to do, ending
with hitching that old tin can to the heels of her
burro, which nearly frightened Billy to death.”</p>

<p>These words seemed to bring to the mind of the
boy the picture of the wildly kicking burro, with his
rolling eyes and comical aspect of terror and anger,
and he suddenly burst into a peal of wild laughter.
In a moment he was convulsed, and it almost seemed
that he was on the point of falling and rolling on the
floor, as he had rolled on the ground outside.</p>

<p>Beneath the window the old Indian continued smoking,
but a grunt that seemed an expression of satisfaction
came from his lips as he heard that burst of
laughter.</p>

<p>Frank did not laugh, but sat there quietly, betraying
no effort to remain grave, until the lad had ceased
to give expression to his merriment.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, however, that Merry found
it no easy task to keep a sober face through that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
burst of laughter, about which there seemed something
strangely infectious.</p>

<p>When the boy had quieted down somewhat, Frank
quietly said:</p>

<p>“You must have forgotten the climax. Felicia,
in her anxiety for Billy, ran out, was knocked down
and hurt. She might have been killed. But what
do you care? You laugh.”</p>

<p>“I do care! I do care!” panted the lad, all the
laughter gone from his face now. “Billy had no
right to hurt her! I’ll kill him if he does it again!”</p>

<p>“Then you think Billy was to blame? Of course
there was nothing to cause Billy’s actions? The old
tin pail that was hitched to his tail had nothing to
do with it?”</p>

<p>The boy’s dark eyes looked Frank full and fearlessly
in the face, but his face flushed. He was quick
to discern the trap into which Merry was luring him,
and, like a flash, he asked:</p>

<p>“Were you ever a boy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” smiled the young athlete; “I believe I
was once on a time.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever have any fun?”</p>

<p>“Lots of it.”</p>

<p>“But you never played any pranks, did you?”</p>

<p>Merry smiled again, seeing how the lad was seeking
to turn the tables on him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“Yes,” Frank confessed unhesitatingly, “I have,
and some of them I afterward regretted. I want you
to profit by my experience. I know how much you
think of Felicia, yet you did not pause to consider
that while you were having sport with her donkey,
Billy, you might give her pain. There is such a thing
as harmless fun, Dick. This prank of yours, like
most of the pranks you play, caused somebody pain.
You are my brother, Dick, and I want you to be a
little more careful.”</p>

<p>“How do I know I’m your brother? My father
never told me anything about you—that is—until——”</p>

<p>Frank’s clear eyes had disconcerted the boy, causing
him to hesitate and falter in the declaration he had
started to make.</p>

<p>“He told you about me before he died,” said Frank
positively. “He told you how my mother was his first
wife, which made us half-brothers, and he also told
you that I would come to take you and care for you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to take me! I won’t let you take
me! I am satisfied here, and I’m going to stay here!
You shall not take me away!”</p>

<p>This was defiance and opposition in earnest, but
the boy could not see that it produced any effect on
the quiet-eyed young man who sat before him.</p>

<p>“When you understand it better, Dick,” said Merry,
“you will be quite willing to do as father desired.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“I won’t! I know what you want. You want to
take me away where there are big towns and lots of
people and every boy has to go to school. I don’t
want to go to school. I can learn all I want to know
without going to school.”</p>

<p>“You think you can, but you would be sure to find
out your mistake when you grew up and became a
man. Next to health, education is the most valuable
possession in the world.”</p>

<p>“Next to health! Why, Old Joe says white folks
in the big towns make their boys and girls go to
school till they get weak and sickly and lose their
health. He says the white boys in towns study till
their chests are flat, and they cough, and their eyes
are weak, and they have to wear glasses, and they
have no muscles, and they never become real men
at all. I’ll never do that! I can read and write and
figure. That is enough education of that kind. Now
Old Joe is teaching me all he knows, and he knows
more than any white man who ever lived.”</p>

<p>“I see Old Joe has given you some false ideas,
Dick,” said Frank quietly, as he stood up. “Take a
look at me. I was brought up in the white man’s
school. Am I flat-chested? Have I a cough? Are
my eyes weak?”</p>

<p>The boy regarded Frank searchingly and silently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
for some moments, and then into his dark eyes came
a look of lofty scorn, as he said:</p>

<p>“You’re a tenderfoot!”</p>

<p>Frank laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Is that why you have taken such an aversion to
me?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“That’s one thing.”</p>

<p>“What’s another?”</p>

<p>“You want to boss me.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?”</p>

<p>“I won’t be bossed by you. I won’t do as you say!
Even if you are my brother, you can’t make me do
just as you want to!”</p>

<p>Under the window the old Indian smoked on, apparently
unhearing or unheeding.</p>

<p>“Dick,” said Merry, “I shall not try to make you
do anything that will be to your harm.”</p>

<p>“You can’t make me do anything, whether it’s to
my harm or not!”</p>

<p>Frank decided that he had been incautious in letting
the word “make” pass his lips. He realized that
this passionate, impulsive lad must be governed by
reason, and that it would not do to try to drive him.
Dick’s proud spirit would rebel against being driven,
even though he knew the object was for his own good.</p>

<p>“You must see from me that not all boys who attend
schools lose their health. In fact, the best schools<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
to-day have gymnasiums and training-rooms where
the students can work every day to become strong,
just as they study to get an education. And all over
the country boys are at work educating their bodies
while they educate their minds. I have lots to tell
you, Dick, about their games and their contests of
strength and skill. I will tell you about baseball, football,
and other games.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to hear! What do I care? I shall
never play any of those games.”</p>

<p>“You may some time.”</p>

<p>“Never! I have made up my mind. They are
silly, and I will not play them.”</p>

<p>“When you get older you will learn that it is bad
policy to form a conclusion or a resolve in regard to
anything you know nothing about.”</p>

<p>“I know enough about those games. Only white
boys play them.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken. At Carlisle there is a school of
Indian boys, and those young Indians learn to play
baseball and football. Every year the Carlisle baseball
and football-teams grow stronger and more difficult
to defeat. They play with all the great college
teams, and they enter into the games with a certain
wild joy and fierceness that make the contests seem
at times like life-and-death struggles. You should see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
the Carlisle football-team come onto the field. Eleven
big, bronzed fellows come trotting out in a bunch
upon the gridiron, the chalk-marks of which look like a
skeleton bleaching in the sun.</p>

<p>“They have long, coal-black hair and flashing eyes.
They have been trained till they are fit to do their
level best. All around that chalk-marked field rise
great wooden stands, containing tier after tier of
human beings, packed in as thick as they can be,
gathered there from hundreds upon hundreds of miles
to witness the game. As the Indians come trotting
out they are given a great cheer from their admirers,
both red and white.</p>

<p>“A football, like a huge yellow egg, is tossed out
on the ground and the Indians begin to chase it about
and fall on it to warm up. While they are at this
there comes another cry, and onto the field comes
the team of the white players. Then in front of those
great tiers of seats men rise and give signals with
waving arms. At those signals the great multitude
breaks into a mighty cheer for the white contestants.
Soon the game is ready to begin. The men line out
on the field, scattering and spreading to their positions.</p>

<p>“The whites have their first kick at the ball, which
has been placed on a certain spot, and the best kicker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
on the team stands off and gets ready. A great hush
falls on the people, who lean forward, lips parted,
eyes staring, waiting for the moment. Slowly and
with steady steps the kicker advances on the ball, while
the players, to the last man, crouch, ready to leap forward.
The leg of the kicker swings back, then forward,
and—plunk!—his toe strikes the ball, which
leaps up from the ground and sails away, away, away,
over the heads of the Indians.</p>

<p>“At the same instant the white players dash down
the field after the ball. Two of them run faster than
all others, darting past the first Indians who get in
their path, and reach the spot where the ball is coming
down. But they cannot touch it again till it has been
touched by an Indian. One of the red men’s swiftest
runners is under it, ready to catch it. It falls into his
hands and he holds it, instantly springing forward to
carry it toward the white players’ territory. One of
the whites leaps at him to clasp him and bring him
down, but, without using his hands, another Indian
player gets in front of the white and blocks him off.
The crowd roars. The runner with the ball dashes
forward. Another white is after him. Both run like
antelopes. The white cannot gain. But past the Indians
who try to stop him comes another white, who
hurls himself headlong like an arrow through the air,
clasping the Indian about the legs, and down they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
come to the ground in a flash. On top of them leap
five or six players, like famished wolves, pinning them
there.</p>

<p>“The great crowd is standing now, and from every
throat goes up a shriek, a yell, or a roar, till a mighty
volume of sound leaps to the sky. The players quickly
get up. The ball is placed just where it was held when
the Indian was brought down by the white. Then
those players pack together in two close masses, facing
each other, crouching, looking into one another’s eyes.
Just a moment. Then the ball is lifted, passed back,
and an Indian goes leaping and plunging right into
the midst of the compact mass of white players, pushed
and jammed and hurled forward by every man of his
own side that can help him, while his friends block off
the whites with their bodies. But the whites can use
their hands, and they hurl the Indians aside, grapple
the one with the ball, down him again.</p>

<p>“The whites have kept their red rivals from making
a gain, and once more the great roar goes up from
the crowd. But next time a man grasps the ball and
goes darting and leaping round one end of the bunch
of players. He dodges two who hurl themselves at
him, he escapes the tacklers, and away he races down
the field, with every man after him, like coyotes running
down a wild horse. One gains, gets close, springs,
and again the man with the ball goes down, with man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
after man jumping on him to pin him fast. Flags are
waving, men are roaring, women are screaming. A
band is playing, but the thundering of the crowd
drowns it. The players rise again. Again they crouch,
ready for the next struggle, and——”</p>

<p>“But I forgot that you do not care for this, Dick.
Of course, you do not want to hear about anything
so silly, and I’ll stop.”</p>

<p>“Don’t stop!” cried the boy breathlessly. “Go on!
Tell me some more.”</p>

<p>Then, as Frank did not resume at once, he stamped
his foot, almost shouting:</p>

<p>“Go on! I must hear it! I will hear it! Tell me
some more.”</p>

<p>Frank knew he had won a point, but he did not
betray satisfaction. However, he compelled Dick to
beg for a continuance, and then went on with his
thrilling account of a football-game, which he made
more thrilling as he advanced.</p>

<p>Merry knew how to play on the feelings of this
spirited, high-strung lad, and he had Dick throbbing
with breathless excitement as he pictured the tide of
battle rolling back and forth over the football-field.</p>

<p>When Merry permitted, in his fanciful recital, the
Indians to score the first touch-down and goal, Dick
actually danced with joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“I knew it!” he cried. “I knew the Indians, who
lived in the open air, could beat the whites, who spend
their days in schools.”</p>

<p>“But the game is not over yet,” said Merry.</p>

<p>He continued, turning the tables with skill, till he
showed how, by superior generalship, the whites finally
defeated their red antagonists. In order to hold the
interest of the boy to the last, he was forced to make
the game very close, but the whites finally won.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they could do it!” said Dick indignantly.</p>

<p>“But they do do it,” said Frank. “Of course, the
Carlisle boys win sometimes, but they cannot defeat
the great colleges, like Yale and Harvard.”</p>

<p>“Then they are not used fairly. The white men
never did use the Indians right.”</p>

<p>“Old Joe has found you an apt pupil,” observed
Merry. “It is true that in many things the red men
have been unfairly treated, but not in football. When
you go East with me, I’ll take you to see some of
the games.”</p>

<p>The dark eyes of the lad sparkled for a moment, and
then he said:</p>

<p>“I’m not going East. I had rather stay here.”</p>

<p>“You will change your mind about that later. In
fact, I am sure you will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“I’ll not leave Felicia and Old Joe.”</p>

<p>“That is loyal of you, Dick. It shows the spirit of
constancy to your friends, and a fellow who is not
constant to his friends is a very poor chap, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said the boy, “I might go just to see
what the East is like, if I didn’t know you’d want me
to go into one of those schools. I’ll not do that, because
I want to be healthy and strong.”</p>

<p>Frank smiled.</p>

<p>“Do I look unhealthy?” he asked.</p>

<p>“N-no; but I don’t believe you could stand it to live
like a cow-puncher.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course you couldn’t! No tenderfoot could.”</p>

<p>This time Merry laughed outright. The wisdom of
the boy was amusing.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll not argue about that; but you can see
that I am not weak-eyed, flat-chested, or sickly. Yet
when I was a year or two younger than you I was
weak and sickly, so that there were fears concerning
my ability to ever become strong and sturdy. I
began to train to acquire strength and health. I
kept at it persistently, and the improvement in a few
months was surprising. At your age I was stronger
than you are now.”</p>

<p>A look of indignant contradiction flashed over the
expressive face of the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“I do not believe it!” he flatly declared.</p>

<p>“It is true,” said Frank. “When I entered the military
school at which I fitted for college I was something
of an athlete, but while at that school I made
the greatest progress. It was there that I really became
an athlete of some consequence.”</p>

<p>Still it was plain the boy was not convinced.</p>

<p>“That school,” continued Merry, “is one of the best
in the country for boys who need building up in body
as well as mind. Since I left it vast improvements
have been made there. When a student enters now
he is compelled to pass a physical examination at the
hands of a competent professor, and all his weak points
are noted and recorded. Every day he is required to
spend a certain length of time in the gymnasium building
up those weak points and strengthening himself
generally. For this very reason Fardale Military
Academy is turning out vigorous, healthy young chaps,
who are well prepared for the strain of study and
competition during their college careers; or, if he does
not enter college, he is ready to begin the battle of
life with a stout heart and plenty of stamina to meet
all sorts of hardships.”</p>

<p>“It’s no use to talk to me,” said the boy stubbornly.
“I don’t want to go to school, and I’m not going.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“I didn’t know you were afraid!” exclaimed Merry,
as if greatly disappointed.</p>

<p>“Afraid?” cried Dick. “Who’s afraid?”</p>

<p>“You must be.”</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p>“You must be afraid to have your weak spots discovered.
You are a trifle hollow just in front of your
shoulders, and your neck is not quite large enough at
the base. You would have to train at Fardale to correct
these weaknesses.”</p>

<p>Dick’s eyes flashed with angry indignation.</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of anything of the sort!” he asserted.</p>

<p>“Oh, then you do not care to become as strong as
the boys who graduate from Fardale Academy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care anything about your old academy!”
cried Dick, his cheeks burning and his hands clenched.
“I don’t believe your stories about great college athletes.
I know you’re not weak, but I’ll bet others are.”</p>

<p>“Hodge is another. You have seen him.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s only two; and I don’t believe you two
are equal to Western men.”</p>

<p>“All my friends,” said Merriwell, “are strong and
athletic. You may have an opportunity to see another
one of them when Hodge gets back from Denver.
He has gone there to meet one of my college<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
chums, who has come West to spend the summer vacation.
I have written to several others, and, unless
I am much disappointed, you’ll have an opportunity
of seeing what sort of fellows they are before very
long.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care anything about them,” said Dick sulkily.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll make you care about them,” was Frank’s
quiet assertion.</p>

<p>“You can’t!” cried the boy, all his spirit of opposition
awakened instantly. “You can’t make me do
anything!”</p>

<p>The look on Frank’s face was one of quiet confidence,
and it seemed to anger the boy more than
words, for it plainly told him that Merry had not the
least doubt about succeeding in his object.</p>

<p>Still into Dick’s mind there had crept a fear that
somehow this handsome, confident brother of his
possessed strength of will sufficient to conquer him,
and this thought made him desperate, so that he was
tempted to exhaust his powers of resistance, just as
a wild bird beats out its strength against the iron bars
of its cage.</p>

<p>“You may go now, Dick,” said Merry quietly.</p>

<p>The boy did not stir, but stood there looking at him
with those defiant black eyes.</p>

<p>Merry, however, sat down and resumed his writing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
just as if Dick had left the room; nor did he give
the lad the least attention.</p>

<p>After a time the boy stole silently out of the room,
and, despite himself, into his heart there stole a sense
of defeat—a growing knowledge that he had encountered
a master mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.<br>

<small>DICK AND OLD JOE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Having been reared in that wild section, and permitted
to have his own way in almost everything,
Dick Merriwell had developed into a high-spirited lad
who fretted like an unbroken mustang beneath the
bit of restraint. To him the thought of giving in to
the will of another was repugnant, even though the
wishes and plans of that other might be for his own
good.</p>

<p>Little did he know that, to a certain extent, the
evidences of pride and spirit he had betrayed had
given his brother considerable satisfaction. Little did
he know that he had convinced Frank that there was
in him the making of something out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>Such, however, was the case. Frank would have
been keenly disappointed had he found his brother
lacking in spirit and determination. Having found
the boy as he was, Merry was studying him and seeking
to discover the best manner to successfully lead
Dick on to his own good. Merry realized that the
task might prove rather difficult, but this gave it all
the more fascination and interest for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>Having left Frank, Dick passed out of the cabin and
walked slowly away. When he had passed beneath
the thick shadows of some trees he felt a touch on his
shoulder, and turned to find Old Joe close behind him.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” exclaimed the boy. “I didn’t know
you were following. I didn’t hear you.”</p>

<p>“Little Hurricane keep him ear open,” grunted the
old fellow. “Joe teach him to hear.”</p>

<p>“I know, Joe, but I was thinking, and I forgot.”</p>

<p>“Must never forget if um want to be like red man.”</p>

<p>“But—but something happened to make me forget.”</p>

<p>“Heap bad!”</p>

<p>“You are right, Joe. It was careless of me.”</p>

<p>“Heap much,” nodded the Indian. “Joe him teach
Little Hurricane to hear snake in grass, bird in air,
panther on moss—everything.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, you have taught me all that, Joe; but
it is Indian lore, and sometimes I forget myself and
know no more than a white man.”</p>

<p>“Must never forget,” repeated Old Joe. “Heap
bad! Some time enemy he ketch um when um have
forget.”</p>

<p>“But it was enough to make anybody forget. My
brother——”</p>

<p>“Joe know; him hear.”</p>

<p>“You heard?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“Ugh!” was the affirmative grunt of the old fellow.
“Me hear. Set under window; hear everything.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of it, Joe? He means
to boss me, Joe! He sha’n’t.”</p>

<p>“Him heap big boss.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>The Indian squatted on the ground, with his back
against a tree.</p>

<p>“Down,” he said.</p>

<p>The boy flung himself on the ground, resting his
head on one elbow and looking into his companion’s
wrinkled face. They were quite alone, where no one
could see them, yet the eyes of the Indian turned
swiftly from side to side, and his ears seemed to be
lifted, like those of a listening catamount.</p>

<p>Dick remained perfectly quiet and waited.</p>

<p>“Him heap big boss,” repeated Old Joe, after some
moments. “Him have way.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Him have way to make all do as him say.”</p>

<p>“He can’t make me do as he says! I’ll never give
up to him!”</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head.</p>

<p>“Little Hurricane him think so now.”</p>

<p>“I know it! I won’t let him be my boss!”</p>

<p>“Old Joe him see something in Steady Hand’s
eye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“You call my brother Steady Hand?”</p>

<p>“Ugh! Him eye heap strong. Old Joe look into it.
Heap strong to make everybody do way him want.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care! He can’t do it with me! I won’t
let him!”</p>

<p>“Think so now; think not so bimeby.”</p>

<p>“Never!” panted the boy. “Why, Joe, he wants
to take me away!”</p>

<p>“Joe know.”</p>

<p>“He wants to put me into school.”</p>

<p>“Joe know.”</p>

<p>“He would make me just like any other boy.”</p>

<p>“Little Hurricane have to go.”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy, Joe! I tell you I won’t, and he
can’t make me! I shall stay here with you—and
Felicia.”</p>

<p>Again the Indian shook his head.</p>

<p>“Steady Hand him strong mind; make you do way
him want,” asserted the old fellow positively. “Him
have strength to do so in him eye. Him know way
to do it.”</p>

<p>The face of the boy paled now, for he placed implicit
confidence in anything the old Indian said.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll kill myself!” he panted, springing up. “I
won’t let him boss me! I’ll kill myself first!”</p>

<p>“Down,” said Old Joe, with a gesture, and, all unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
that he was obeying a master, the boy
dropped to the ground again.</p>

<p>For some moments the aged Indian was silent,
looking fixedly at the lad.</p>

<p>“Mebbe it be better,” he said.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” demanded Dick.
“Maybe what will be better?”</p>

<p>“For you to do same Steady Hand want.”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy!” again asserted the boy. “I can’t
do it! I will not be shut up in any old school. I
love the open air and the freedom of the mountains
and plains! I love to wander alone in the deep forest
and listen to its murmuring voice. The trees
talk to me, Joe, and all the wild creatures know me.
Do you think I am fool enough to give this up for
a stifling schoolroom and the study of books that
will make my head ache and make me weak? I tell
you I will kill myself first!”</p>

<p>The face of the Indian remained grave and expressionless,
but there was a twinkle of pride and satisfaction
in his keen old eyes.</p>

<p>“You have Injun heart,” he said. “You skin white;
heart Injun.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a fool, and I won’t let him make me one!”</p>

<p>“Then only one thing um can do.”</p>

<p>“What is it? Tell me, Joe!”</p>

<p>“Go ’way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>Dick caught his breath.</p>

<p>“Go away?”</p>

<p>“Ugh!”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Anywhere.”</p>

<p>“You mean to run away?”</p>

<p>“Ugh!”</p>

<p>“And leave Felicia?”</p>

<p>“Some time um come back. Steady Hand take
um, um never come back.”</p>

<p>“Run away—alone?”</p>

<p>“Old Joe him don’t have to stay.”</p>

<p>The face of the boy flushed, and he panted:</p>

<p>“You will go—you’ll go with me, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Ugh! Joe him ’bout ready to go. Him tired stay
here.”</p>

<p>“And you will take me with you—where?”</p>

<p>“Prairie big, mountains deep,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“And they will not be able to find us?”</p>

<p>“Never find Old Joe.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” the boy suddenly decided. “Joe, I’ll
go with you anywhere to get away from him. And
we’ll go this very night!”</p>

<p>Old Joe Crowfoot returned to his seat by the cabin
wall and resumed his smoking, apparently perfectly
contented.</p>

<p>Dick wandered away by himself, passing through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
the woods, which led down to the shore of Lake Sunshine.</p>

<p>The boy was happy again, believing that he was
going to remain his own master and live the wild, free
life that he loved, so he whistled as he passed through
the woods. His whistling was like the warbling of
a mocking-bird, full of liquid sweetness and trills, and
soon he was answered from the branches overhead,
where the flit of wings could be seen. He was calling
the birds in their own language, and they were answering.
The strange notes that came from his pursed
lips were marvelous to hear, and the birds came flying
after him, flitting from tree to tree.</p>

<p>By the shore of the lake he found a comfortable
spot beneath a wide-spreading tree, and there he flung
himself on the ground, continuing his birdlike calls.
The birds gathered on the branches above him, looking
down at him with fearless curiosity.</p>

<p>A squirrel chattered not far away, and immediately
the sound was perfectly imitated by the boy, who added
to it the call that the squirrel makes to its mate. Soon
the handsome little fellow came leaping from limb to
limb of the trees until he had reached the one beneath
which the boy rested. Then, by fits and starts, he
descended to the ground and approached the lad. In
a few moments Dick had called the wild squirrel of
the woods to his knee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>Then down from the tree dropped a bird, alighting
on Dick’s shoulder. The other birds drew nearer and
nearer until nearly all were gathered on the lower
branches of the tree.</p>

<p>Behold Dick Merriwell, the wild, strange boy of
this mountain valley, in all his glory, king of the birds.
This is the life that appeals to him and to which he
clings. This is what he declines to forsake for school
or any of the advantages which Frank Merriwell has
offered to give him.</p>

<p>Dick laughed and talked to the squirrel, his voice
low, soft, and musical. The squirrel whisked his tail
over his back and looked the lad fearlessly in the face.
A jealous bird darted down at the squirrel and compelled
the little animal to hop from the boy’s knee.</p>

<p>“Oh, ha, ha, ha!” laughed Dick softly. “Quarreling,
are you? Stop it—stop it this minute! There’s room
enough for you both. No need to be jealous. Frank
tells about his friends. What are his friends compared
to mine! I would not give up my friends for all of
his.”</p>

<p>For some time he remained there, with his wild
friends about him. At last, a voice was heard calling
through the woods:</p>

<p>“Dick! Dick! Where are you, Dick?”</p>

<p>The squirrel started up in a listening attitude, while
two or three of the birds flew away at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Dick! Oh, Dick! Where are you?”</p>

<p>It was the voice of Felicia.</p>

<p>“She won’t hurt you,” said the boy, to the squirrel
and the birds. “You need not be afraid of her.”</p>

<p>The little girl was heard coming through the woods,
and more of the birds took alarm, quickly darting away
on silent wings.</p>

<p>“Here, Felicia—here I am,” answered Dick.</p>

<p>The squirrel did not stop longer. With a flirt of its
tail, it bounded to the trunk of the tree, up which it
scampered.</p>

<p>Felicia came running toward the tree, but when she
got there the squirrel was gone and not a bird remained.</p>

<p>This seemed strange enough, for surely Felicia was
the more gentle of the two in appearance, and she
was so tender-hearted that for the world she would
not harm the weakest creature in all creation.</p>

<p>But about the boy there was a certain quality that
few human beings possess—a magnetism that attracted
the wild things of nature. He had listened to the
voices of these creatures and learned their calls. He
had watched them till he knew all their ways. And
his heart went out to them in sympathy, for their
wild, free life seemed to him the perfect life.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know where you were, Dick,” said little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
Felicia, her dark eyes full of gladness because she had
found him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you’d care,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Care?” she cried, flinging her arms about his neck
and kissing him. “Why, how can you say that?
What do you mean? You know, Dick—you know how
much I love you!”</p>

<p>“After—after I did—that?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You know—to Billy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Dick—yes! I know you didn’t mean to
hurt Billy.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t hurt him, Felicia.”</p>

<p>“But it frightened him.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it,” the boy declared. “He was
standing there asleep. I found the old tin can, and
I thought what fun it would be to hitch it to his tail.
Then I got a string, tied it to the pail, made a loop, and
slipped it onto Billy’s tail.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder Billy didn’t kick you.”</p>

<p>“He would if anybody else had tried the trick, but
I don’t suppose he thought I’d do such a thing. I betrayed
Billy’s confidence in me.”</p>

<p>“You won’t do it again, will you, Dick?”</p>

<p>“No. I wouldn’t have done it then if I’d stopped
to think how much you would care.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“Oh, you dear Dick!”</p>

<p>She gave him a loving hug.</p>

<p>“But it was awfully funny!” he cried, his laughter
beginning to bubble up within him. “Oh, you should
have seen Billy when I let the old thing bang against
his heels! Oh, dear! how he did jump! Oh, my!
how he did kick! Then he brayed and kicked, and
the old pail came banging back against his heels every
time. And he rolled his eyes round at it and looked
so comical—so comical! Oh, ha! ha! ha! Ha! ha!
ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>The elfish laughter of the strange lad filled the forest
with its merry sound. Convulsed with merriment over
the remembrance, Dick lay on the ground and clung
to his sides, while Felicia stood near, compelled to
laugh despite herself.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re so happy, Dick!” she said.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash the laughter stopped and the merriment
left his face.</p>

<p>“I’m not happy!” he said, sitting up.</p>

<p>“Not happy?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“No, I’m miserable!” he declared.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Felicia. “Is it anything I have
done?”</p>

<p>“No, no! It’s him!”</p>

<p>“Him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“My brother.”</p>

<p>“Frank?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What has he done?”</p>

<p>“I hate him!”</p>

<p>“Did he punish you?”</p>

<p>“I guess not! You don’t think he’d dare? But I
hate him!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dick! you mustn’t forget that he is your
brother!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care! What right has he to be my brother?
I don’t want a brother! All I want is you, Felicia!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t talk that way! It’s wrong!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if it is! Do you know what he wants
to do? Well, he wants to take me away—away from
you!”</p>

<p>She gave a little cry and clung to him.</p>

<p>“He wants to put me in an old school. I’m not
going to school, for I know enough of that kind of
learning now.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to do what he says.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think so! He can’t make me do it!
He’ll find that he can’t!”</p>

<p>“It was in your papa’s will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“That doesn’t make any difference; I won’t do it,
just the same.”</p>

<p>“What can you do?”</p>

<p>“I am going to run away!” answered the boy
promptly. “I’m going off where he can’t follow, and
he’ll never get me—never, never, never!”</p>

<small>AWAKENED JEALOUSY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Little Felicia uttered a cry of horror, her face
paling.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, Dick!” she exclaimed, getting hold of
him with both hands. “You don’t mean that! Why,
I’ll never see you again! Oh, Dick! Dick!”</p>

<p>She was filled with fear and distress at the thought,
and she clung to him as if afraid that he would start
at once.</p>

<p>“Oh, but you will see me again!” he quickly declared.
“That is why I am running away. It’s so,
after he is gone, I can come back to you.”</p>

<p>“But where will you go? Where can you go?”</p>

<p>“Old Joe knows. I have been with him before.
He will take care of me.”</p>

<p>“Old Joe? Then he——”</p>

<p>“Is going with me. You mustn’t tell, Felicia. We
are going away this night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so soon?”</p>

<p>“The sooner the better. I can’t stay here, for I
will not let that man be my master.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you do not have to go so soon! He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
doesn’t wish to take you away from here yet. You
may stay with me a little longer, Dick.”</p>

<p>“No one knows when he may make up his mind
to take me away. He wants to carry me away off
to the East, and put me into a school, where I know
I should die. It is dangerous to wait, Felicia.”</p>

<p>The girl fell to sobbing, and he put his arm about
her.</p>

<p>“There, there!” he said, in a soft and soothing voice.
“Don’t cry about it, dear cousin—please don’t. I’ll
come back to you—I swear it! Before long I will be
a man, and then he can’t take me from you. I’ll
stay with you always then.”</p>

<p>He soothed her after a little, kissing away the tears.</p>

<p>“But you must promise not to tell a soul about what
I am going to do,” he suddenly said. “He must not
know it, for he would try to stop me.”</p>

<p>“If he should——”</p>

<p>“He’d better not try it!” panted the boy, his dark
eyes flashing. “I am going with Old Joe away into
the mountains, and he can never find me. After a
while he will get sick of hunting for me, and then
he’ll go away. Joe will know when he goes away,
and I’ll come back here to you.”</p>

<p>Her face brightened a little.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad you’ll come back! But do you
think it is right?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“What?”</p>

<p>“Running away.”</p>

<p>“What’s the difference?”</p>

<p>“He is so good, and—and I can’t help—liking him,
Dick.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way. Once or twice I’ve almost felt
that way, but I won’t let myself. I know what he
means to do with me, and I just won’t like him!”</p>

<p>“But perhaps what he means to do would be for
your good, Dick. Other boys go to school, and——”</p>

<p>“Some do, and some don’t! Old Joe says those
who don’t are better off than those who do.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Old Joe knows?”</p>

<p>“Of course he does!” exclaimed the boy confidently.
“Old Joe taught me to call the birds and the beasts.
He taught me to follow a trail and to shoot and do
many things that no boy ever learns in school. He
is a better teacher than all the schoolmasters in the
whole world.”</p>

<p>“But some time you may have to do things that
Old Joe does not understand, and then——”</p>

<p>“Never, for I’m going to live my whole life away
from the big towns. You shall live with me, Felicia,
and we’ll be just as happy as—as the birds. Now
listen—to-night, when everything is still, I am going.
Old Joe will be waiting for me over by the big Black
Rock. When morning comes, and they find I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
gone, we shall be so far away that no one can catch
us. Then I want you to tell them that I ran away
because I would not let my brother be my master.
Will you tell them that, Felicia?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dick—I’ll do anything for you.”</p>

<p>“Dear Felicia! Be brave, and I’ll come back to
you. Don’t tell that I’m ever coming back, because
then he might stay and watch for me. That would
simply keep me away, for I shall know how long
he stays and when he goes. If you wish me to return
soon, don’t tell.”</p>

<p>She promised that she would not, though in her
heart she felt that she was doing something wrong.
For him, however, she would do it. He was the
only playmate she had ever known, and she thought
him the most wonderful boy in all the world.</p>

<p>Sometimes Felicia had sat quite still at a distance
and watched Dick call the birds and the tiny wild
things of the woods about him, delighted and amazed
by his power. But when she had tried to approach
they had fled; when she sought to call them they
would not respond. She could not understand the
mystery of it, but in her mind was the conviction that
Dick was like the wild creatures that approached him
without fear, and now it seemed wrong for any one
to think of taking him from the scenes he loved and
placing him in a school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“I’ll think of you every day when I’m away, Felicia,”
he promised.</p>

<p>“And I’ll think of you, Dick,” she murmured.
“When I say my prayers at night I’ll pray for you.”</p>

<p>“Dear little Felicia!” he exclaimed again. “We
won’t let my bad brother separate us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do not think he is bad, Dick—I can’t think
that! He is handsome, and he has such a good face!”</p>

<p>A strange light appeared in the eyes of the lad,
while he flushed hotly.</p>

<p>“He knows how to fool people,” said Dick; “but
I know he’s bad.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” cried Felicia. “He has held me on his
knee and told me stories and talked to me. You are
wrong, Dick. He is not bad.”</p>

<p>“He is! he is!” panted the boy, in a sudden burst
of jealousy. “Don’t ever let him take you on his knee
again, Felicia!” He grasped her by the wrists and
glared into her startled eyes. “Promise me that you
will not let him take you on his knee again. Promise!
promise!”</p>

<p>She was frightened by his sudden fierceness, and
the clutch on her wrists caused her to cry out with
pain:</p>

<p>“Oh, oh! you are hurting me! I’ll promise; only
don’t hurt me!”</p>

<p>Her face paled and showed her pain, which struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
him to the heart with remorse. Instantly he released
her wrists and clasped his arm about her, saying
pleadingly:</p>

<p>“Forgive me, please forgive me! I didn’t mean to
hurt you—truly, I didn’t! But it made me mad to
think about you sitting on his knee, and I didn’t know
what I was doing. Oh, say I did not hurt you
much!”</p>

<p>He kissed her wrists and showered her with caresses,
his manner full of passionate devotion.</p>

<p>“You hurt just a little,” she declared bravely; “but
it was only for a minute. It’s all gone now—now
you have kissed it, Dick.”</p>

<p>“If you knew how I hate to leave you even for a
little while!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“If you knew how I hate to have you go!” she
breathed.</p>

<p>“My brave, sweet little cousin!” he said, with the
air of a manly lover. “But you must not sit on
Frank’s knee, and you must keep away from him
as much as you can. Promise me that you will do
as I ask.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll promise, Dick!”</p>

<p>“Don’t look at him when he talks to you—don’t
look into his eyes. If you do, he will get the best
of you, for there is something in his eyes that it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
hard to resist. I don’t know what it is, but I have
felt it.”</p>

<p>He led her to make many promises of the sort, and
she did so, though she knew it would be difficult for
her to keep some of them.</p>

<p>“There!” he exclaimed, in satisfaction; “he’ll find
he cannot master me! He’ll find he cannot force me
to the school that makes cowards and weak men.”</p>

<p>“But he is no coward,” asserted Felicia. “You
should have seen him fight the ruffian who was carrying
me off the day he first came into this valley. That
man was a giant, and he was strong and fierce; but
Frank grappled with him, grasped his wrist when he
tried to use his knife, threw him, and knocked him
senseless. Oh, he must be awfully strong!”</p>

<p>Again Dick was green with jealousy.</p>

<p>“Bah!” he cried. “The ruffian must have been
drunk. Don’t tell me any more about it! In a few
years I will be able to handle him. Now we will go
back to the house, and you must be careful in your
actions not to do anything that will make any one
suspect what is going to happen. You will be careful?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dick. What am I to do?”</p>

<p>“Act just as you always do—not differently. Be
happy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“Don’t speak a word about it near the house. Don’t
let Old Joe know that I have told you.”</p>

<p>She promised, and they started for the cabin, walking
hand in hand through the woods. They came to
the path after a while, along which they made their
way.</p>

<p>Just before they came within sight of the cabin,
Felicia suddenly stopped and flung her arms about
Dick’s neck, brokenly exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Oh, Dick! how can I let you go away to-night—how
can I? I shall lay awake and think about it! I
shall know when you meet Old Joe at Black Rock!
I shall see you stealing away together! I shall see
you hurrying into the mountains!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” he said. “You must not speak of it again
till I am gone. We are too near the house.”</p>

<p>“Kiss me good-by!” she half-sobbed.</p>

<p>They exchanged kisses, and then they romped away
toward the cabin, like thoughtless children. And
Dick’s laugh rang loudly through the woods—the wild,
elfish laughter that was characteristic of him.</p>

<p>Beside the cabin Old Joe Crowfoot smoked in grim
silence.</p>

<p>But within the cabin Frank Merriwell was no longer
writing. His chair and table were deserted, and he
was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.<br>

<small>AN INTERRUPTED DEPARTURE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The night was still and serene, with a large round
moon, clear as burnished silver, shedding its light
down into Pleasant Valley. Away to the west stood
the ragged mountains, with the stars gleaming bright
above their snow-capped peaks.</p>

<p>In the Black Woods the shadows were dense. The
moonlight sifted down and fell on the front of the
little cabin, but the rear of the cabin was in darkness.
From the back door moved a form that made no noise,
but hastened away as lightly as possible, slipping round
into the path. Before plunging into the woods, the
form paused and turned back to the cabin, toward
which a kiss was tossed.</p>

<p>“Good-by, home! good-by, Felicia!” murmured
Dick Merriwell, for Dick it was. “I am driven out,
but I’ll come back when he is gone. I am free as
the birds, and free I will remain. Good-by.”</p>

<p>Then he turned his back on the cabin and hastened
noiselessly along the path.</p>

<p>When he thought how amazed Frank would be in
the morning he felt like dancing and shouting with
delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“Oh, I’d like to see his face!” he chuckled. “It
would be such fun! It would be more fun than it was
to see Billy roll his eyes round at the old pail.”</p>

<p>When he came to the edge of the woods he did not
hesitate to step out into the moonlight, for now there
was no fear in his heart that any one save Old Joe
would see him.</p>

<p>Straight toward Black Rock, at a little distance
from the shore of the lake, he hastened. There were
some trees near the rock, and Dick fancied the old
Indian was waiting in their shadows.</p>

<p>At some distance from the rock Dick paused and
gave the hoot of the horned owl. Immediately, from
a point near the rock, the howl of a coyote rose and
quavered on the still night air.</p>

<p>“Joe is there!” laughed the boy. “He is waiting,
and all is well.”</p>

<p>Then he ran forward. Near the rock a figure rose
to meet him. It was Crowfoot.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted the Indian. “You come. Old
Joe think it time.”</p>

<p>“I waited till I was sure everybody was asleep,”
said Dick. “Besides, I was bound to let him know he
was not my master and that I had beaten him.”</p>

<p>“What you do?”</p>

<p>“I wrote on a slip of paper, ‘Good-by, Frank Merriwell;
I am gone, and you’ll never catch me. I ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
away because I would not let you be my boss. It
won’t do you a bit of good to try to find me.’ Then
I signed my name to it. And I slipped into his room
and put it where he would find it first thing in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“Waste time,” declared the Indian. “Might been
catched.”</p>

<p>“He was sound asleep in his bed. I could see his
form under the clothes, but I could not hear him
breathing. I got out just as quick as I could.”</p>

<p>“Now we get away,” said the Indian. “Get good
start before morning.”</p>

<p>He had a rifle in his hands, while his old blanket
was folded and fastened on his shoulders, so that he
was in marching-trim.</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” said the boy. “I’ll follow you, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Come.”</p>

<p>The Indian started, with the boy at his heels, but
as they passed round the rock they were amazed to
see standing before them a silent figure in the moonlight—a
man, with his arms folded over his breast.</p>

<p>Dick gave a little cry, while Old Joe stopped, half-lifting
his rifle.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” said a pleasant voice. “Isn’t it
rather late for a moonlight stroll?”</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell stood there before them!</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted the astounded redskin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>The boy was amazed and bewildered, for he had
felt certain that Merry was fast asleep in bed in the
cabin.</p>

<p>“It’s a lovely night, I know,” said Merry, in his
calm, self-possessed manner; “but a boy like Dick
should be in bed. Where were you thinking of going?”</p>

<p>“It’s none of your business!” cried the lad chokingly.</p>

<p>“I rather think it is,” was the serene retort. “If
you will not tell me, I shall be compelled to tell you.
I know all about it. You were thinking of going
away, Dick. You were going to run away from me.”</p>

<p>“I am going to now!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“I am! I will! You can’t stop me!”</p>

<p>“I have stopped you already. You will go no farther.”</p>

<p>“Boy go with me,” said Old Joe, fingering his rifle.
“Get out of way!”</p>

<p>“He will return to the cabin with me,” asserted
Frank confidently.</p>

<p>“No take him back!” declared Old Joe. “Get out
way, or shoot um quick!”</p>

<p>“Don’t try it,” advised Merry. “I am his brother,
and I know what is best for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>“He different from you,” said the redskin. “He
like me better. He going to be like red man.”</p>

<p>“Hardly!” exclaimed Frank dryly. “I have no
time to waste words with you, Crowfoot; but I tell
you now, for the first and last time, that I will not
have you monkeying with my brother or trying to
thwart me in my plans. If you——”</p>

<p>The old Indian was enraged, and he suddenly flung
his rifle up to shoot Frank straight through the body,
but, with a sharp cry, the boy made a leap and knocked
the barrel of the weapon aside.</p>

<p>Just in time! The rifle spoke, and the bullet whistled
close to Frank.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Dick,” said Merriwell coolly, as he
swiftly advanced. “That is the second time you have
kept this old heathen from salting me, and I’ll not
forget it.”</p>

<p>He stopped close to Old Joe, at whom he looked
fearlessly.</p>

<p>“Crowfoot,” he said, “you have twice attempted
my life. If you try the trick again, I’ll shoot you
down like a dog! I don’t want to do it, but I do not
propose to have you make a target of me. I could
have shot you just now. See here!”</p>

<p>Then Merry displayed a revolver which he had held
clasped in his hand all the while, the weapon being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
concealed under one arm as his hands were folded
over his breast.</p>

<p>“I could shoot you now,” Frank went on; “but I
do not wish to do so. You have filled this boy’s head
with false notions, but I am going to drive those notions
out of his head. You have taught him some
things of value, but even you were not shrewd enough
to discover me as I lay in the little hollow there and
waited for this meeting. I was here ahead of you, and
I concealed myself, as I was taught to do by one of
your own race. In my bed I left a dummy figure,
which deceived Dick, and——”</p>

<p>“How did you know anything about it?” panted the
boy, in wonder. “Did Felicia tell you?”</p>

<p>“Not a word.”</p>

<p>“Then how did you know?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the birds told me,” said Frank, in a mysterious
way.</p>

<p>Dick started.</p>

<p>“The birds?” he said, thinking how he had called
the feathered creatures of the woods about him just
before he revealed his secret to Felicia.</p>

<p>Then a strange thought came to the lad. Had the
birds listened as he told the little girl of his plans,
and had Frank somehow obtained the knowledge from
them? The fact that Merry had learned of those
plans somehow, and had appeared to intercept the boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
in his flight, seemed singular indeed; but the possibility
that he had obtained his knowledge in some
marvelously mysterious manner from the birds was
bewildering.</p>

<p>A feeling of awe came upon Dick. He was struck
by the conviction that it was impossible to keep anything
from his wonderful brother.</p>

<p>Old Joe was not so much impressed, although he
was not a little chagrined over his failure to discover
Frank waiting in the vicinity of the rock.</p>

<p>“Come, Dick,” said Merry quietly; “we will go
back to the cabin. To-morrow we’ll talk over your
plan to run away with Crowfoot, and, if you can convince
me that it is for your good, I’ll let you go with
him. I am going to do just what is for your good.”</p>

<p>This did not satisfy the boy by any means, but he
was overawed and subdued by the powerful will of
his brother, and he offered no further resistance.</p>

<p>Old Joe was disgusted and indignant.</p>

<p>“You go with him?” he asked of Dick.</p>

<p>The boy nodded.</p>

<p>“It’s no use now, Joe,” he said, with resignation.
“He knows all about it. It wouldn’t do me any good
to run away now. I’m going back.”</p>

<p>The old Indian grunted.</p>

<p>“Go!” he cried. “Old Joe, him go to the mountains.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>Then, to the surprise of both the boy and the Indian,
Merry turned to Old Joe, saying:</p>

<p>“Crowfoot, come back to the cabin. I want you
to stay and teach Dick all that you can.”</p>

<p>The Indian seemed incredulous.</p>

<p>“You fool Old Joe,” he declared.</p>

<p>“I am not in the habit of fooling,” Merry asserted.
“I speak the truth; I want you to teach him as much
as you can. I believe that no man acquires useless
knowledge. It may seem that he does, but, some time
during his life, he is certain to find need of it. It
always has been my policy to keep my eyes and ears
open and learn all that I could. I know something
of Indian lore, for I am not quite the tenderfoot I
look, and one of my friends was a young Indian by the
name of John Swiftwing.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Crowfoot. “Him go to Injun
school, marry half-blood squaw?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Old Joe know um.”</p>

<p>“You know him?”</p>

<p>“Him live in mountains, not hundred mile from
here.”</p>

<p>“Crowfoot, are you telling me the truth?”</p>

<p>The Indian relapsed into indignant silence.</p>

<p>“You did not tell me the truth the first time I saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
you,” said Frank. “Why should I not ask the question?”</p>

<p>“No know um then.”</p>

<p>“And, now that you know me, you are ready to
shoot me in a moment. Still, I want you to come
back to the cabin. Dick need not fear that I am going
to take him away to school right off. I have no
thought of doing so now, and he’ll not have to go until
he is perfectly willing. If you, Crowfoot, know where
Swiftwing is to be found, I want you to take me to
him. I shall be glad to pay you in any possible way
for your trouble.”</p>

<p>The Indian stood still and looked at the boy. Frank
also looked at Dick, who immediately said:</p>

<p>“I am going back to the cabin, Joe. Won’t you
come?”</p>

<p>But the old fellow seemed offended.</p>

<p>“No,” he said; “not now.”</p>

<p>Dick knew it was useless to try to persuade Old Joe,
and so he did not make the attempt.</p>

<p>“Mebbe come in one, two day,” said Crowfoot.
“Mebbe not come at all.”</p>

<p>Then, without even bidding Dick good-by, the
strange old redskin turned and strode away, soon passing
from the moonlight into the shadow of the deep
woods, which hid him from view.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX.<br>

<small>READY ARRIVES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Not a word did Frank say about Dick’s attempt
to run away, and, as they had returned to and entered
the cabin quietly, Juan Delores knew nothing
of it.</p>

<p>Of course, Felicia was amazed and overjoyed when,
the following morning, she found Dick still there.
Dick would say nothing save that he had decided not
to go away for a while.</p>

<p>Old Joe was gone, but as the Indian had a habit
of disappearing and appearing without warning, nothing
was thought of this.</p>

<p>In spite of himself, deep down in his heart Dick
Merriwell felt further respect for his brother. He
was compelled to confess to himself that Frank was
very clever, and he came to stand in some awe of him.
Still, he persisted in his determination not to let Merry
“boss” him.</p>

<p>“I’ll always be free,” he muttered over and over.
“I’ll never go into a school. He can’t make me do
that.”</p>

<p>But he wondered greatly how Frank had discovered
that he was going away at all. He did not know that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
Merry had left the cabin by the back door, while Old
Joe smoked by the wall, and strayed into the woods.
He did not know that Merry had paused by the path
and knelt to examine a wild flower he found growing
there. And, while Frank was kneeling thus, Dick and
Felicia came along the path. From the little portion
of their talk, that Merriwell heard as they bade each
other good-by, he learned that Dick was going away
with Old Joe, whom he would meet that night near
Black Rock.</p>

<p>And thus it happened that Frank was on hand at
that meeting.</p>

<p>Merry was satisfied that his strange, wild, young
brother cared for him more than he wished any one
to know, else he would not have made such frantic
haste to disconcert Old Joe’s aim. Had the Indian
shot Merry down, Dick would have been free forever,
yet the boy sprang at once to prevent that act.</p>

<p>Frank wished to win his brother to him without
using force. It was his desire to bend Dick’s strong
will and passionate nature, but not to break either.
The young athlete was convinced that there was in
Dick the making of a remarkable lad, and he hoped
to handle him in the proper manner to bring out his
best qualities.</p>

<p>But first it was necessary to win the obstinate and
wilful spirit to him, and that seemed like a difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
task indeed. However, Merry felt that he had scored
heavily in preventing the runaway as he did. He had
not resorted to force, but he had convinced Dick that
he was in some things a match for Old Joe, whom the
lad admired.</p>

<p>On the day after the attempted runaway, Bart
Hodge and Jack Ready came riding up the valley.
Business had called Ready to Denver, and Hodge had
met him there. His business attended to, Jack was
willing and eager to hasten to Frank in the quiet little
valley under the shadow of the Rockies.</p>

<p>Frank was watching for them, and he sighted them
through a field-glass as they came galloping up the
valley.</p>

<p>Dick and Felicia were also watching, with strange,
silent Juan Delores not far away.</p>

<p>“It’s another of his friends,” said Dick, in a low
tone to Felicia. “I’m sure this one will show signs
of his long days spent in study. He must be round-shouldered
and weak.”</p>

<p>As the two riders drew nearer they spurred on their
horses and raced for the woods. It was a wild neck-and-neck
dash, and, although Bart seemed to sit his
horse a trifle better than Jack, the latter managed to be
in at the finish.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” he whooped, waving his hat about his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
head and flinging himself from the saddle. “The pardon
has arrived in time! Your royal muchness, here
we are, hide, hoof and horns. Behold us, adorned in
all the glory of the wild Western cowboy. Are we
not peaches?”</p>

<p>Then he grasped Frank’s hand, gave it a furious
shake, and bent to press his lips upon it.</p>

<p>“I salute ye, oh, mighty potentate, whatever that is,”
said Jack, in his familiar breezy manner. “I know you
are overjoyed to gaze once more on my beautiful
countenance, and I am very, very glad because you
are so happy.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t seem to be round-shouldered,” whispered
Felicia.</p>

<p>“Not—very—much,” faltered Dick.</p>

<p>“And he doesn’t look weak.”</p>

<p>“Not—very—weak,” admitted the boy.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t wear glasses.”</p>

<p>“He may have them in his pocket and put them on
when he reads,” said the lad, as if he really hoped so.</p>

<p>“And he can ride well.”</p>

<p>“Pretty well,” confessed Dick. “But he’s just like
the other one, in one thing; he acknowledged my
brother as his superior.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice it.”</p>

<p>“I did. It was in his manner.”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought his manner very lofty and proud.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“But, just the same, there was something in it that
confessed Frank Merriwell his master. I wonder if
all my brother’s friends are like that.”</p>

<p>The boy’s sharp eyes had read the truth, and his
sensation was one of mingled regret and pride, for,
despite himself, he could not help being proud that
Frank was a leader of men.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you, Jack,” said Merriwell, in his
hearty way, that left no doubt as to his sincerity.</p>

<p>“I told you that you were,” nodded Ready, with a
haughty pose. “And I have traveled far to make you
glad.”</p>

<p>“Wish you had brought all the fellows along with
you.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed Ready, with a wave of his hand.
“Methinks I have a thought. Why not gather the
clans together and once more swoop down on the wild
and woolly? We wiped up everything on the turf
last year; why not do a little wiping this year?”</p>

<p>“You mean——”</p>

<p>“Why not call the boys together, organize a baseball-team,
and indulge in the lively sport of killing umpires?
What sayest thou? Is it not a radiant
thought?”</p>

<p>“I have thought of it myself.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Jack, in dismay. “Wouldst even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
rob me of the only original thought I ever possessed?
Alas!”</p>

<p>“He is very queer,” said Felicia to Dick.</p>

<p>“Very!” said Dick, frowning. “I saw a crazy man
once that acted like him.”</p>

<p>Which Jack would not have regarded as very complimentary
had he heard it.</p>

<p>Merry introduced Ready to Juan Delores, and then
said:</p>

<p>“Ready, this is my little cousin Felicia, and this is
my brother Dick.”</p>

<p>“Queen Felicia, I salute you,” said Jack, bowing
low, his hat in his left hand and his right hand pressed
over his heart. “Before I came, you must have been
the sweetest thing in all this wild region. Of course
I can’t help being sweet myself, for I was born that
way, and you must not blame me if all the flies flock
my way.”</p>

<p>Then he turned and looked at Dick.</p>

<p>“So you are Frank Merriwell’s brother!” he exclaimed.
“Well, my boy, I want to tell you that there
are a few million chaps like you who would just about
give their blooming lives to be able to honestly call
Frank Merriwell brother. They’d rather have him for
a brother than to have the President of the United
States for a father. You are a dead lucky chap, and
that’s straight goods.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>The lips of the boy were pressed together for a
moment, and then he retorted:</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I wish it was some one of those few
million boys who want him for a brother who had
him instead of me!”</p>

<p>“What’s this?” cried Jack, aghast. “Treason! Who
ever heard of such a thing? Boy, you’re crazy!”</p>

<p>But Dick stood up defiantly, his proud lips curling
with scorn.</p>

<p>“A regular heart-blow!” muttered Ready weakly.
“Is this a sample of the brothers you pick up, Merry?
Oh, my, my! And you the idol of Yale!”</p>

<p>Frank laughed.</p>

<p>“I enjoy it, Ready,” he said, and his manner seemed
to indicate that he told the truth. “I don’t think I ever
had anything satisfy me more than has this rebellious
disposition of my high-spirited young brother here.”</p>

<p>This made Dick tremble with anger.</p>

<p>“I’m not doing it to please you!” he cried. “I
won’t please you!”</p>

<p>But Merry simply smiled.</p>

<p>“You can’t help it, Dick,” he asserted. “In disliking
me so ardently you have provided me with a new sensation.
I assure you that it has given me pleasure to
watch and study you.”</p>

<p>“I won’t be watched and studied!” cried the lad.
“I’ll keep away from you! Oh, how I hate you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>Then he turned and fled from the spot.</p>

<p>Dick felt humiliated and ashamed, for it seemed
that Frank had laughed at him before his friends.
Ridicule to a boy of his passionate disposition was a
dreadful thing, which cut deeper than the keenest
blade.</p>

<p>Jack Ready regarded the whole affair as a joke,
and he sought to banter Merry about his peppery young
brother.</p>

<p>“A regular untamed young colt,” he observed.
“Never saw anything just like him. He’s a bird,
Merriwell. I’m afraid you’ll have hard work breaking
him to the saddle.”</p>

<p>Hodge had brought some baseballs, two bats, and a
catcher’s mitt from Denver, and the following day
the three young men got out in a clear place in the
valley and began to practise.</p>

<p>Felicia saw them first, and she ran to Dick with
an account of what they were doing.</p>

<p>“Why, they throw the ball at each other just as
hard as they can,” she said, “and they catch it in
their hands, just as easy. It’s fun to watch them.
Come and see them, Dick.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“And they have got a stick that they hit it with,”
she went on. “One of them takes the ball, gives it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
a little toss, then strikes it with the stick and knocks
it so high in the air that you can hardly see it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet they don’t catch it then,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“But they do,” asserted the girl. “Then others run
and get under it, and catch it with their bare hands.”</p>

<p>“It must be soft,” said the boy.</p>

<p>His curiosity was aroused, and, after a time, he
permitted Felicia to lure him down to the open valley,
where they could watch Frank, Bart, and Jack practising.</p>

<p>In short order Dick became intensely interested, and
it was not long before he ventured out where the trio
were, Felicia following now.</p>

<p>Indeed, it seemed rather surprising that the ball
could be batted so far into the air and caught with
such ease, even though the one who caught it sometimes
had to run with all his might to get under it
when it came down.</p>

<p>“Could you do that, Dick?” asked Felicia.</p>

<p>“Of course I could!” he answered, for he did not
wish her to think there was any such accomplishment
possessed by these tenderfoots that he did not also
have.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that Jack Ready heard the question
and the answer.</p>

<p>“What, ho!” he cried. “Here is another player for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
our ball-team. Stand forth, Richard, and show your
skill.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Dick, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha!” exclaimed Jack. “Methinks thou art fearful
as to the result. In other words, you’re putting up
a bluff.”</p>

<p>This was too much, so Dick walked out to catch
the ball. Jack himself seized the bat, observing:</p>

<p>“I’ll place the sphere in your fingers, Richard, my
son. Let us see if you can freeze to it.”</p>

<p>Then he knocked a comparatively easy one. Dick
got under it, but, when the ball struck his hands, it
immediately bounced out and dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>And it hurt his hands in a most surprising manner,
for he found it almost as hard as a stone.</p>

<p>Dick did not betray that he was hurt.</p>

<p>“You must squeeze it, young man,” chirped Ready.
“That is one of the first things to learn. When a ball
strikes in your hands, close your fingers on it and
squeeze it hard.”</p>

<p>Angry and disgusted, Dick caught up the ball and
threw it straight at Ready with all his strength.</p>

<p>Now, the boy could throw a round stone with remarkable
accuracy, as well as great speed, and he
had used all his strength in this case. Imagine his
surprise when Ready carelessly thrust out one hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
and caught the whizzing ball as if the feat was the
simplest thing in the world.</p>

<p>Dick looked at Frank. If Merriwell had laughed
then, it is possible the boy would have stopped in a
perfect tempest of anger; but Frank stood aside, looking
quite grave and interested.</p>

<p>“I will catch it!” thought the lad. “I’ll show him
that I can catch it!”</p>

<p>Then he cried for Jack to hit out another one.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the stuff from which heroes and ball-players
are made,” said Ready, as he complied.</p>

<p>This time Jack did not bat the ball directly into
Dick’s hands, and the latter was forced to run after
it a little. Again he got his hands on it, and this
time he managed to catch it.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Frank approvingly. “That was well
done!”</p>

<p>To the amazement of Dick himself, he thrilled with
satisfaction on hearing those words of praise from
Frank. But he would not try to catch any more then.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” laughed Ready. “You have a level
head, for you know when to retire on your laurels.
I wish I knew as much. I would have retired long
ago.”</p>

<p>Then Bart Hodge put on the big mitt, while Ready
stood up to strike the ball. A flat stone was the plate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
and from it Frank paced off the regular pitching-distance.</p>

<p>Then, with great speed, Frank pitched the ball.
Ready fanned, and Bart caught it, close under the bat.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell caught his breath, and watched with
still greater interest.</p>

<p>“Fooled me that time,” said Jack. “Put ’em over
now, and I’ll drive out a three-bagger.”</p>

<p>“What is a three-bagger, Dick?” asked Felicia, who
had found his side again.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he was forced to admit.</p>

<p>“You did catch the ball, didn’t you?” she said
proudly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was all he answered.</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t near so high as they knocked it before.”</p>

<p>Dick shrugged his shoulders, declaring:</p>

<p>“If I had some practise, I could catch it just as
high as anybody.”</p>

<p>“But it must be dangerous. You won’t do it, will
you, Dick?”</p>

<p>Now, danger was the very thing that served as a
lure to lead the boy on, and he retorted:</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m going to try it some more. I like it.”</p>

<p>Frank sent in another swift one, and again Jack
failed to hit it, though he struck at it handsomely.</p>

<p>“The double-shoot!” he shouted. “Oh, Laura! but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
that was a peach! It twisted both ways as quick as a
flash.”</p>

<p>“What is he talking about?” muttered Dick. “I
didn’t see it twist.”</p>

<p>He moved around to get another position, and
chance happened to lead him behind Bart, at some
distance.</p>

<p>Then, when Frank pitched again, Dick saw the ball
come whistling straight ahead, and suddenly dart off
to one side, while Ready missed it a third time.</p>

<p>“Nothing but an out!” said Jack, in disgust. “And
I thought it was going to be another double.”</p>

<p>“No wonder he can’t hit it,” thought Dick. “Why,
the ball didn’t go straight! I wonder what made it
go off to one side like that.”</p>

<p>The next one, however, amazed him more than anything
else he had seen, for it seemed to start curving
one way, and then suddenly change and curve the
other.</p>

<p>“Another double-shoot!” exploded Ready, in disgust.
“Say, stop it, will you! You’re the only pitcher
in the country who can throw the ball, so I don’t care
to practise batting against it. Give me just the plain,
ordinary curves.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Frank. “I was trying it simply
to see if I had good control and command of it.
Next one will be of the ordinary kind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>It was an in shoot, but Jack hit it a good crack, and
joyously cried:</p>

<p>“Safe hit! Oh, me! oh, my! Wasn’t that clever of
me?”</p>

<p>“You’d never got a hit like that off him in a game,
and you know it,” said Hodge, while Merry was after
the ball. “He’s the greatest pitcher who ever came
out of a college in this country.”</p>

<p>“Admitted, my boy,” nodded Jack. “And he has
a reputation from the Atlantic to the Pacific. He’s a
wonder, and everybody knows it.”</p>

<p>Again Dick Merriwell felt a strange thrill of satisfaction
and pride, and to himself he unconsciously
whispered:</p>

<p>“He’s my brother!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.<br>

<small>WINNING HIS WAY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>What he had seen and heard that day wrought a
change in Dick Merriwell. Although he had never
witnessed a game of baseball, he began to feel an
intense longing to see one. He pictured it in his mind,
and the picture was far from correct, but it served to
add to his growing desire.</p>

<p>He heard Frank say that he had written to several
of his friends, and the trio of young athletes began
to discuss the possibility of getting enough of the old
crowd together to form a ball-team. They spoke of
the excitement of the games and the sport they could
have, and Dick Merriwell’s interest increased steadily
as he listened.</p>

<p>“I’d give anything to see one of those games!” he
told himself.</p>

<p>When the three went out to practise Dick accompanied
them, and, after that first day, he did not hesitate
to try to catch the batted balls. To him it seemed
that these efforts were rather discouraging, for he
often muffed or misjudged them; but he did not know
that both Ready and Hodge had told Merry that the
way in which he handled himself and clung to the ball<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
was astonishing for a chap of his years who had never
seen a ball before.</p>

<p>Inwardly Frank was well pleased about the interest
Dick was taking, but he did not betray his feelings,
nor did he praise the boy. Instead of praising, he
sometimes criticized. However, he did not permit his
criticism to savor of ridicule.</p>

<p>Merry well knew that some natures can be much
better spurred on by criticism than by praise, and it
is often the case that praise seems positively harmful
to a growing boy or a developing youth. He had
seen many good ball-players spoiled by praise, while
few had been harmed, to his knowledge, by criticism.</p>

<p>Occasionally a lad may be able to stand praise, which
may serve to spur him on; and, once in a while, severe
criticism is absolutely harmful. Once in a while a
boy may be ridiculed into doing his best, but always
ridicule is a last resort, for it generally does more
harm than good.</p>

<p>Frank knew that a proud and sensitive lad like Dick
could not stand ridicule, although what seemed like
honest criticism would arouse his nature and lead him
to persistent effort. So Merry avoided any show of
ridicule when he spoke freely of Dick’s failings.</p>

<p>Ready would have praised the lad openly, but Merriwell
took care to warn Jack against doing so. Hodge
did not need such a warning, as he was not in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
habit of praising anybody, with the single exception
of Frank.</p>

<p>Merry’s critical words cut Dick deeply, seeming
to arouse a tempest of anger within him.</p>

<p>“He thinks I’m not as smart as the boys who go
to schools!” the indignant lad told Felicia one day.</p>

<p>“What makes you think that?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know—I can tell! He doesn’t think me very
smart. He doesn’t think I could ever play ball if I
tried, but I’d like to show him!”</p>

<p>Now this was the very feeling that Frank had sought
to awaken in his spirited brother, for he knew it would
serve to spur the boy on.</p>

<p>Sometimes Frank, Bart, and Jack talked of old
times and the excitement of the baseball-games in
which they had participated, and then, if he fancied
himself unobserved, Dick would linger near and listen,
though he pretended to take no interest whatever in
what they were saying.</p>

<p>More and more the desire grew within him to witness
a regular ball-game. He was a boy who loved
excitement, and he pictured the dashing, desperate
struggle of two baseball-nines, with the cheering spectators
to urge them on.</p>

<p>One day Frank left the valley, with Dick for a companion,
and rode to Urmiston. They were mounted on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
two spirited horses, and the lad took delight in giving
Merry a hard race to the little town, but found that
the “tenderfoot” was pretty nearly a perfect horseman.</p>

<p>At Urmiston, Merriwell received two letters which
seemed to give him considerable satisfaction, but, after
reading them, he thrust them both into his pocket, saying
nothing at that time of their contents. On the
way back to Pleasant Valley, however, Merry suddenly
observed:</p>

<p>“Well, Dick, I am going away soon.”</p>

<p>“Are you?” said the boy. “That is good!”</p>

<p>“I thought you would be glad of it. A number of
my friends are coming from the East, and we are
going to organize a baseball-team. We’ll play such
clubs as we can get games with, and so pass the summer.”</p>

<p>Dick said nothing.</p>

<p>“We’ll have lots of sport this summer,” Merry
went on. “It’s too bad you can’t see some of the
games. But, then, I don’t suppose you care anything
about them?”</p>

<p>The heart of the boy gave a strange throb. Then
Frank had decided to go away and leave him behind!</p>

<p>“Why won’t I see any of them?” he asked. “You
are going to make me go with you, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the quiet answer.</p>

<p>“But—you—said——” Then Dick choked and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
stopped, his mixed emotions getting the mastery of
him.</p>

<p>“I might have taken you with us if I had not found
that you were so set against it,” Frank said. “But
I have come to the conclusion that it will be better
to leave you behind. Then I shall not be bothered
with you.”</p>

<p>The face of the lad flushed with angry indignation,
and his dark eyes flashed.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is it!” he cried scornfully. “You pretended
at first that you were so greatly interested in
me that you were ready to do anything for me, but
now I know that it was all pretense, and that you
simply wanted to make me uncomfortable. Father
said that you were to take care of me and see that I
received proper training, but, just as soon as you think
I may be a little bother to you, you are ready to drop
me. That shows what kind of a brother you are!
I’m glad I’ve found out! I wouldn’t go with you now
if you wanted me to! You couldn’t make me go with
you!”</p>

<p>“It’s true,” said Frank quietly, “that father wanted
me to take care of you, but it may be that he did not
know the kind of a task he was imposing on me. If
you were the right kind of a boy, I’d do everything in
my power to your advantage, no matter how much
trouble it cost me; but it is evident that you prefer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
run wild and come up in any old way. You choose
your ignorance in preference to all the advantages
I could give you. I fear I could not make much of a
man of you, anyhow, so why should I try?”</p>

<p>The lad trembled from his head to his feet with the
intensity of his rage. Then, all at once, he savagely
cried:</p>

<p>“You can’t throw me over that way! I won’t let
you! You’re getting tired of me, but I’ll make you
do just what father said you were to do! You shall
not go away and leave me here! I’ll go with you!
I will! I will! I will!”</p>

<p>“Don’t get so excited about it,” advised Frank.
“That’s where you show a weak spot. If you ever become
a successful man in this world, you must learn
to govern your temper. You let yourself——”</p>

<p>But Dick refused to listen longer, and, fiercely cutting
his horse with his quirt, he went dashing madly
toward the distant valley, Frank following behind.</p>

<p>There was a satisfied smile on Merriwell’s face, for
he felt that he was winning in his struggle with the
obstinate spirit of the boy. But he took care not to
let Dick see that smile.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the cabin home of Juan Delores,
Old Joe Crowfoot was there, sitting with his
back against the wall, grimly smoking his pipe.</p>

<p>He did not even look up as they approached.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI.<br>

<small>FROM THE JAWS OF DEATH.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The following day, guided by Old Joe, a party set
out on a journey to the mountains, in a secluded valley
of which, the old Indian declared, John Swiftwing
lived with his half-blood wife. The party was made
up of Frank, Bart, Jack, Dick, and the old redskin.</p>

<p>They did not start till past midday, and it was their
plan to camp out for at least one night. All were well
mounted and armed and prepared for roughing it.</p>

<p>Dick had dressed himself in the half-Mexican finery
he was wearing the first time Frank saw him. Those
were the clothes in which Juan Delores delighted to
see the lad attired.</p>

<p>Dick bade Felicia an affectionate adieu, promising
to return within two days. At first she had feared
he was going away for good, and the thought had
nearly broken her heart; but she was relieved when
Frank gave her his word that they would return.</p>

<p>That night they camped by a stream that came down
from the mountains and flowed out through a broad
valley, in which a great herd of cattle was grazing.</p>

<p>Old Joe had discovered “antelope sign” some hours
before, and he set out to shoot one of the creatures.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
But Merriwell took a fancy to see what he could do,
and, by skirting a ridge that kept him from view of
the antelopes, he reached a point where he could obtain
a good shot at them when they were alarmed by
the Indian and took to flight.</p>

<p>Thus it happened, much to Dick’s amazement, that
Frank brought in the antelope, while Old Joe returned
empty-handed.</p>

<p>This seemed something like a marvel to the lad,
but, if possible, Old Joe was even more astonished,
and, although he tried to conceal it, he felt deeply
chagrined over the outcome of the affair.</p>

<p>Joe, however, insisted on cooking the juicy steak
cut from the slain antelope, and, though he felt that
he could do it quite as well himself, Merry did not
refuse the old fellow this privilege.</p>

<p>The smoke of their camp-fire rose in a blue column.
Behind them rose the cottonwoods by the stream, and
the majestic mountains towered close at hand. Soon
the coffee-pot was simmering on some coals raked out
from the fire, sending forth a delightful odor that
gave every one a feeling of ravenous hunger.</p>

<p>Wrapped in his old red blanket, Crowfoot squatted
by the fire and broiled the antelope steak, smoking his
pipe.</p>

<p>No one observed that Dick had slipped away. They
were talking of college days, and the conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
served to make them forgetful of their romantic surroundings.</p>

<p>“Alas!” sighed Ready, “old Yale will not seem like
it used to be, now that Merry has taken himself hence,
his radiant brow wreathed in undying laurels.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I’m through,” asserted Bart. “I couldn’t
stay there another year.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be hard on me,” confessed Jack. “But I’ll
have to stand it. There is one satisfaction in the
thought that there will be no one in Yale to dispute
my claim to the honor of being the most beautiful
and highly intellectual chap on the campus. But the
football-games—oh, my! And the baseball-games—oh,
me! What will they be without Merry? Oh, Lud!
I shall think with breaking heart of the days gone by,
when the only and original Frank Merriwell reigned.
I shall listen in vain for the acclaiming populace to
thunder forth his name. Nevermore! ah, nevermore!”</p>

<p>Then, as Jack pretended to weep, there came a sudden
and startling interruption. There was a clatter of
hoofs, a shout, and a cry of warning.</p>

<p>They started and turned. Bearing down upon them
was a wild-eyed steer, and, astride the back of the
animal, they saw Dick Merriwell!</p>

<p>“Look out! Jump!” cried Frank, as, with lowered
head, the frightened steer charged straight for the
fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>“Make way for the gentleman!” cried Ready, scrambling
aside in ludicrous haste.</p>

<p>Bart Hodge got out of the way without a word.</p>

<p>And right through the smoke, leaping over the fire,
went the steer, while a wild peal of laughter came from
the lips of the daredevil boy astride the back of the
creature.</p>

<p>“Oh, ha! ha! ha! ha!” shouted the lad. “Ha! ha!
ha! Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“Talk about your untamed catamounts!” gurgled
Ready. “Why, that boy is the worst yet!”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Old Joe. “Him got Injun heart.”</p>

<p>But Frank said not a word, as he leaped to his
feet and ran toward the spot where his horse was
picketed.</p>

<p>Merry knew Dick was in danger, for the wild steer
might run at that mad pace for miles and miles, and
there was no telling what might happen when the lad
got off the creature’s back.</p>

<p>Merry’s horse snorted as he came up, backing away
and flinging up its head; but he seized the picket-rope
and quickly had the beast by the head.</p>

<p>Up came the picket, and Frank quickly flung himself
on the back of the horse, without stopping to
saddle his mount. Then he whirled the horse’s head
toward the spot where he could see the steer careering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
down the valley, and gave the bronco the end of the
rope.</p>

<p>He was off in pursuit, wondering how it happened
that Dick had managed to get astride the steer.</p>

<p>The explanation was simple enough. Dick had wandered
away to the stream, where he climbed into the
lower branches of a tree. The steer came along to
drink, and the reckless youngster dropped astride his
back.</p>

<p>Merriwell urged the horse to its fastest pace, guiding
it with the picket-rope. He did not look back to see
if any of the others followed, but kept his eyes on the
steer that was bearing the boy away.</p>

<p>The herd of cattle at a distance looked up in alarm
as the frightened steer approached. Merry feared they
might stampede, with the steer ridden by the boy at
their head.</p>

<p>As the animal approached the rest of the cattle, it
suddenly swerved to one side and made a half-circle.
Then it partly stopped, and, seizing the opportunity,
Dick slipped from its back to the ground.</p>

<p>Frank lashed his horse still harder, for he knew
that Dick was now in the greatest peril of all. The
cattle of the plains are used to the sight of mounted
men, whom they respect and fear; but the spectacle
of a human being on foot attracts them, first arousing
their curiosity and then their rage. Woe to the hapless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
man who is thus discovered by a herd of cattle,
for, unless he can quickly find shelter of some sort,
he is almost certain to be charged upon, gored, and
trampled.</p>

<p>Knowing this, Merry raced to the rescue of his
brother, his heart in his throat.</p>

<p>The steer ran a short distance, and then turned
and looked at the boy, pawing the ground. The cattle
began to approach, gathering in on the lad.</p>

<p>“Keep still!” muttered Frank, as he again lashed
his horse. “Face them, Dick—face them!”</p>

<p>The boy did face them at first, but they gathered
thicker and thicker. One after another they began
to bellow and paw the ground. Their eyes glared,
and their aspect was awesome indeed.</p>

<p>The boy turned and moved away, upon which the
herd started after him. He looked back over his
shoulder and saw them coming. The bright colors in
his clothes aided in arousing them. Then Dick saw
Frank racing toward him, and he turned in that direction.</p>

<p>“Keep still!” shouted Merry. “Don’t run! don’t
run!”</p>

<p>But the only word Dick understood was:</p>

<p>“Run!”</p>

<p>Immediately he started running toward the approaching
horseman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>In a moment the great herd was moving after him,
faster, faster, faster. There rose a rumble of hoofs
that was terrifying, a clatter of horns like musketry,
and behind the mass of cattle floated upward a dust-cloud
that resembled the smoke of battle.</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell urged his horse to its utmost, bending
forward and seeking to estimate the possibility
of reaching the boy in time.</p>

<p>Dick ran for his life, well knowing that certain
death was seeking to overtake him.</p>

<p>Nearer, nearer, nearer! Then Frank shouted:</p>

<p>“Stand still! Make ready!”</p>

<p>It seemed that the rushing herd must sweep them
both down, but Frank charged athwart the crest of
the mass of animals.</p>

<p>Fortunately the boy heard and understood this time.
He stopped and partly lifted his arms, but, knowing
that to pick him up while dashing at full speed on
horseback was a feat worthy of a most experienced
and expert cowboy, there was doubt and fear in his
heart.</p>

<p>Frank leaned over, clinging to the neck of the horse.
It seemed that he meant to run the boy down, he
went so close to Dick. As he passed, he made a clutch
at the strong sash of the lad—caught it—held fast.</p>

<p>The boy was lifted by Frank’s powerful arm. He
felt himself raised and flung across the horse in front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
of his brother, and then the doubly burdened horse
wheeled and swept away from beneath the very noses
of the cattle.</p>

<p>The herd did not follow far. The cattle seemed
surprised at the sudden disappearance of their intended
victim, and they quickly settled down and
stopped.</p>

<p>When they were safely away, Frank lifted Dick,
holding an arm about him. The lad looked at Merry’s
face and saw it was very pale, but strong, and resolute,
and masterful.</p>

<p>“That was a close call, Dick,” said Frank quietly.
“I was afraid once that I’d not get there in time.”</p>

<p>Not a word of reproach or reproof. In that moment
the heart of Dick Merriwell went out to his
brother in a great leap of affection.</p>

<p>“Frank,” he said, his voice not quite steady, “I—I
want to stay with you—always.”</p>

<p>“You shall, Dick!” promised Frank.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII.<br>

<small>CHALLENGED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“For the love of goodness!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Look at this!”</p>

<p>Bart Hodge did not often get excited and express
his feelings by ejaculations, but now he was the first
speaker. Merriwell was the one who asked the question,
and Bart thrust the paper he had been reading
toward Frank as he said, “Look at this.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Merry.</p>

<p>“There!” said Bart, pointing his index-finger at
the article that had excited his astonishment. “Just
read that, will you!”</p>

<p>The matter under observation was headed, “Baseball
Challenge,” and read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is reported that Frank Merriwell, late captain
of the Yale baseball and football-team, is in the vicinity
of Denver, having brought with him a picked ball-team,
with which he proposes to wipe up the earth with anything
and everything he can find west of the Mississippi.
Such being the case, as manager of the Denver
Reds, the champion independent baseball-team of the
State of Colorado, I challenge Merriwell’s team to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
game of ball, to be played in Denver any time within
ten days, for a purse and the entire gate-receipts.</p>

<p>“I am confident that my team can show the collegians
a few points in our great national game, and I
believe that as a pitcher Merriwell has been greatly
overrated. Everybody with sense knows that the
story that he can throw a ball that will curve both in
and out before reaching the batter is perfectly ridiculous,
and, in case he has sufficient courage to accept
this challenge, the Reds have the utmost confidence
that they can bat him out of the box before the end
of the third inning.</p>

<p>“It is admitted that last season he did manage an
independent team that won a number of victories, defeating
a Denver club, but I contend that the majority
of the nines playing against him were made up of the
rankest amateurs, and that not one team in the list
was in the same class with the Reds. Not knowing
Mr. Merriwell’s present address, I take this means of
placing my challenge before him, but I sadly fear that
he will not have sufficient courage to accept.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">David Morley</span>, Mgr. Denver Reds.”</p>
</div>

<p>They were sitting in the lobby of the Metropole
Hotel in the city of Denver, where they had met
Browning, Rattleton, Gamp, and Carker that day by
appointment.</p>

<p>The expedition that had set out to find Swiftwing
had not been successful. They had found only his
deserted shanty. The Indian and his wife were gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>When he had finished reading the challenge, Frank
laughed quietly, but, on looking up, saw Hodge was
scowling blackly.</p>

<p>“That’s a case of unbounded confidence, isn’t it,
Bart?”</p>

<p>“Unbounded insolence, I call it!” growled Hodge.
“Why, that challenge is almost an insult—it is an insult!”</p>

<p>“It’s pretty plain language,” Frank admitted.</p>

<p>“Plain! It’s rank! Why, the fellow says you
haven’t courage enough to accept!”</p>

<p>“Well, it is an easy matter to convince him that he
has made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“But he sneers at your pitching.”</p>

<p>“Possibly I may be able to take some of his sneering
out of him in a game, if I happen to be in form.”</p>

<p>“I know you can, Merriwell, but the crust of it is
what galls me. He says you have been overrated.”</p>

<p>“Probably he thinks so.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s got another think coming to him.”</p>

<p>“This is exactly what we are looking for, Hodge.
We have pulled ourselves together to play ball, and
we——”</p>

<p>“We haven’t had any practise.”</p>

<p>“Morley gives us enough time for that. We can
play him any time within ten days.”</p>

<p>“Besides, we are two men short, and I don’t see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
how we are going to fill out the nine. Stubbs can’t
come, and Mason’s mother died at just the time to
prevent him from joining us, and here we are. It’s
out that you have a ball-team, and this duffer flings
us a challenge.”</p>

<p>Bart’s warm blood had been stirred by the offensive
challenge in the Denver paper, and he was not
in a pleasant mood.</p>

<p>“If we had found Swiftwing——” Merry began.</p>

<p>“But we didn’t,” Hodge cut in.</p>

<p>“I’d give a little to know where he has gone.”</p>

<p>“Old Joe said he would find him. And that’s the
last we have heard of Old Joe. I don’t believe we’ll
ever see anything of that old vagrant again.”</p>

<p>“Somehow I have a fancy that Old Joe will turn
up with news of Swiftwing.”</p>

<p>“What if he does? He may not turn up in time
to do any good, and you can’t remain idle and wait
for something that may happen. You must accept
that challenge, Frank.”</p>

<p>“I intend to,” came quietly from Merry’s lips.</p>

<p>“Without the two men needed?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to pick up men somehow. Now, there’s
Berlin Carson——”</p>

<p>“Speaking of me, Merriwell?”</p>

<p>Both Frank and Bart started and turned as the
words fell on their ears. Toward them advanced a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
prepossessing youth, who had observed them sitting
there as he was passing through the lobby.</p>

<p>“Carson, as I live!” exclaimed Frank, in deep satisfaction,
as he quickly rose and extended his hand.</p>

<p>With a long, quick stride, the newcomer approached
and grasped the proffered hand, his blue eyes beaming
with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Merriwell, I am overjoyed!” he declared. “I heard
you were somewhere in Colorado, but I had not the
least idea of running across you here. It’s lucky the
governor sent me into town on business at this time.”</p>

<p>“Lucky for us,” nodded Frank, as Carson and
Hodge shook hands. “You are the eighth man for
our ball-team, if we can get you to come in with us.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the Colorado lad showed his satisfaction.</p>

<p>“You can count on me for anything, Merriwell,”
he asserted. “The governor is sure to let me join
you, for he thinks you are just about the proper thing,
and he has thought so ever since he first met you. He
knows I’d never made the varsity nine if it hadn’t
been for you, and that makes him think all the more
of you. You may count on me. Where are your other
men?”</p>

<p>“They’re out looking the city over.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?”</p>

<p>Frank told him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“All good men but Carker,” said Carson; “and he
can put up a good game when he gets right down to
it.”</p>

<p>“But we’re still a man short,” said Hodge. “Merriwell
has a brother, a perfect little wonder; but he’s
too young—only thirteen.”</p>

<p>“A brother?” exclaimed Carson, who knew nothing
of recent developments in connection with Frank.</p>

<p>Then Merriwell briefly outlined the whole strange
story, having a very interested listener.</p>

<p>“He’s a wonder,” Hodge again declared, referring
to Dick Merriwell; “but he has never seen a regular
game of ball in his life. He had some balls, mitts,
and a bat out there in Pleasant Valley, where he has
always lived, and you should have seen him get after
the ball. Why, that boy has more sand than any fellow
I ever saw, and he is made up of determination.
He just sets his teeth and catches anything that is
tossed up to him. Merry has begun to teach him to
pitch.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Frank, “and he is furious because he
can’t get onto the trick of throwing the double-shoot.
He swears he’ll do it if he lives long enough.”</p>

<p>“That’s the true Merriwell stuff,” nodded Carson.
“I’ve never seen him, but I’ll bet my life he’ll make
a bird.”</p>

<p>“But it’s useless to think of playing him,” said Merriwell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
“Besides being too young, he knows next to
nothing about the game. I’m going to take him round
with me this summer and give him all the education
in the ball-playing line that I can.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to find a man,” said Berlin. “I
know some players, and I’ll——”</p>

<p>Just then something happened that caused the trio
to wheel about instantly.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII.<br>

<small>DICK MERRIWELL’S NERVE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“Take your dog away, sir! Take him away, or I’ll
shoot him!”</p>

<p>A clear, boyish voice rang through the lobby of the
hotel.</p>

<p>“Black” Ben Elrich, one of the best known sporting
men and gamblers of the State, had just passed along
the corridor, accompanied by two companions of his
ilk and a huge, fierce-looking mastiff.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell, running lightly into the corridor,
had been stopped by the dog, which suddenly whirled
on him and drove him back several steps, seeming on
the point of leaping at the lad’s throat.</p>

<p>For some unknown reason the dog seemed to have
taken a sudden dislike to the boy, and, as he growled
and showed his teeth, he looked dangerous, indeed.</p>

<p>Immediately on being driven back by the dog, Dick
had drawn a revolver, which he held ready for use.
Elrich uttered an exclamation of astonishment and
anger.</p>

<p>“Stop Rex, Dan!” he exclaimed. “Get hold of him,
Tom! He’ll chew up the kid!”</p>

<p>“He won’t do that,” returned the boy instantly, “for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
I shall shoot him in his tracks if you don’t take care
of him.”</p>

<p>The men accompanying Elrich leaped forward, one
on either side of the dog, and grasped the huge animal
by the collar. Barely had they seized him thus when
the animal tried to make a spring at the throat of the
boy, and it took their combined strength to hold him
in check. “It’s a good thing for him that you grabbed
him just when you did,” exclaimed the cool youngster.
“I knew he was going to jump, and I’d sure shot
him.”</p>

<p>“Why, confound you, kid!” growled Elrich, as the
men pulled the dog back; “how dare you pull a revolver
on my dog?”</p>

<p>“I’d pull a gun on your dog just as quick as I would
on you,” returned Dick. “I don’t consider your dog
much better than you, sir, though it’s right likely he
is some.”</p>

<p>“That is my brother!” said Frank Merriwell to Berlin
Carson.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a hummer!” exclaimed the rancher’s
son, in deep admiration.</p>

<p>“Let’s sift in and take part in that,” breathed Hodge
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Wait,” advised Frank. “I want to see what that
black-whiskered fellow will try to do, and I also wish
to see how Dick handles himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>The big sporting man was angered by the words of
the ready-tongued youngster, and he growled:</p>

<p>“You’re an insolent brat, and you need to be taught
a lesson!”</p>

<p>“I scarcely think it would be to my advantage to
have you for an instructor,” returned the lad. “Anything
I’d learn of you would be an injury to me.”</p>

<p>Now, “Black” Elrich had killed his man, and was
generally respected and feared by the dangerous element
of the town, and it was a novel experience for
him to have anybody fearlessly face him and talk to
him in such a manner.</p>

<p>“I’d begin by wringing your neck!” he asserted.
“It’s just what you deserve!”</p>

<p>“And I’d shoot you so full of holes that you’d
make a first-class sieve, which would be just what you
deserve,” retorted Dick Merriwell, his cheeks burning.</p>

<p>“If you were a man——”</p>

<p>“Don’t let that bother you, mister. I can take care
of myself. Keep your hands out of sight, or I may
think you’re reaching for a shooting-iron, in which
case I shall not hesitate to break your elbow with a
bullet.”</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t know how to handle such a toy as
that!”</p>

<p>“Don’t I? Perhaps not, but I’ve had a few lessons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
from a man who is your master with any kind of a
weapon.”</p>

<p>“Meaning you?” asked Carson of Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Meaning an old Indian by the name of Joe Crowfoot,”
explained Frank, in a low tone. “Crowfoot
taught him to shoot rifle, revolver, and bow and arrow,
and he’s a credit to his tutor.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a mere kid, and you have no right to
carry concealed weapons,” said Elrich.</p>

<p>“And you’re a mere ruffian, who has less right to
carry concealed weapons,” flung back Dick. “I know
you’ve got a gun on your hip, and I shall ask to have
you searched if you make complaint against me.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” muttered Carson. “He’s sized
up Black Elrich in a minute, and he’s bluffing the most
dangerous man in Denver.”</p>

<p>The eyes of Bart Hodge glowed with satisfaction.
Bart had never spoken a word of praise to Dick, but
there was about the boy much that awakened his admiration.</p>

<p>“Where’s your father?” demanded the gambler,
furiously. “I’ll call on him and see if he——”</p>

<p>“You’ll never call on him,” Dick declared, “for
you’re not going in his direction. He’s up there.”</p>

<p>The boy pointed upward, and Black Ben thought he
meant that his father was above in the hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“What’s his name?” demanded the man. “I’ll go
up to him at once.”</p>

<p>“Spare yourself the trouble, for it’s higher than
you’ll ever get. He is dead.”</p>

<p>For a moment the man was taken aback, and then
his fiery temper flamed up.</p>

<p>“You’re some runaway brat who thinks——”</p>

<p>“Stop!” exclaimed the lad. “That is the second
time you have called me a brat, and I warn you not
to do so again! I am not a brat, and I——”</p>

<p>At this point one of the men who had pulled the
dog away stepped in by a side door and clutched the
wrist of the boy, giving it a wrench and twisting the
revolver away with his other hand.</p>

<p>It was done in a twinkling, and Black Elrich sprang
forward. At the same moment Merriwell advanced,
with his two companions at his heels.</p>

<p>But, before one of them could interfere, out through
the same door strode a tall form that caught the man
who had clutched Dick, grasped him by the neck, gave
him a swing and a throw that flung him fifteen feet
away, sprawling on the tiled floor of the corridor.</p>

<p>Behind this tall figure came another, about the shoulders
of which was a dirty red blanket, perchance the
most remarkable figure ever seen in the Hotel Metropole.</p>

<p>Both were Indians, but the first, almost six feet tall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
and straight as an arrow, was dressed in the garments
of civilization. The other, however, must have attracted
attention anywhere in Denver from his half-savage
attire. The first was young and handsome;
the second was old and wrinkled.</p>

<p>“Joe!” cried the boy, as he saw the old Indian.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” said Old Joe Crowfoot.</p>

<p>With a furious exclamation, Black Elrich started
to whip out a revolver; but his wrist was clutched
from behind by fingers that seemed like bands of steel,
and he was held fast, while a quiet voice spoke in his
ear:</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t try that trick, sir! You have been
monkeying with my brother, and I shall have to call
you to account if he is molested further.”</p>

<p>Elrich was trembling with the intensity of his rage.</p>

<p>“Let go!” he panted, as he looked round.</p>

<p>A pair of calm brown eyes looked into his with utter
fearlessness, and Frank Merriwell spoke again:</p>

<p>“I shall not let go until you realize the folly of
trying to do any shooting here. Two friends are with
me, besides the two who have just interfered to protect
my brother, and we can do some shooting when
it is necessary.”</p>

<p>Elrich became cool at once.</p>

<p>“I see that you have the advantage, sir,” he said;
“and I will not be foolish enough to draw. I give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
you the word of Ben Elrich, and my word is good,
whatever else may be said about me.”</p>

<p>Instantly Frank released the wrist of the man.</p>

<p>“I accept your word of honor,” he said.</p>

<p>“But let me tell you,” said the baffled gambler,
“that I’ll not forget what has happened here. You
say that boy is your brother? Well, you had better
take care of him.”</p>

<p>“I have an idea that, given a fair show, he can take
care of himself. He proved quite able to do so until
one of your friends caught him at a disadvantage by
a trick. It took two men to get the best of a boy
of thirteen, which is something I feel certain you will
not be proud of.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded Elrich. “I may wish
to see you again.”</p>

<p>“My name is Frank Merriwell, and you will find
me right here at this hotel, for a day or two, at least.”</p>

<p>“Frank Merriwell!” muttered Black Ben, starting a
trifle, and looking at Merry with added interest. “And
this is your brother?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>Then the gambler turned and looked at Dick, as if
fixing the features of the boy upon his memory, so that
he would know the lad again, anywhere and under any
circumstances.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV.<br>

<small>MERRY’S CHUMS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When the chagrined and defeated Elrich, together
with his worthy companion, had departed from the
corridor, Frank Merriwell lost no time in offering
his hand to the handsome young Indian who had intervened
in time to save Dick from further molestation.</p>

<p>“Swiftwing!” Merry exclaimed, in deep satisfaction.
“I am glad to see you.”</p>

<p>The face of the Indian remained grave, but deep
in his eyes shone a light that told his unspeakable
emotions.</p>

<p>“Frank Merriwell,” he said, in a deep, well-modulated
voice, “once I thought never to look on your
face again, but fate has permitted us to meet once
more.”</p>

<p>Frank thought of the farewell message written him
by the Carlisle Indian almost a year before, in which
Swiftwing had expressed the affection and admiration
that his tongue had never spoken. Their hand lingered
in contact, and then Hodge offered to shake.</p>

<p>Bart had never liked Swiftwing much, but now he
was truly glad to see the young Indian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>Old Joe Crowfoot stood there like a mummy, his
keen black eyes watching all that took place.</p>

<p>“It’s a great piece of luck,” said Merry. “You are
the man to fill out our baseball-team.”</p>

<p>“It is not luck,” said Swiftwing. “Crowfoot came
to me and told me you had been searching for me.”</p>

<p>“Then I have Crowfoot to thank?”</p>

<p>“Old Joe, him tell you he bring Swiftwing,” said
the old fellow quietly.</p>

<p>“And you have kept your promise.”</p>

<p>“Not for you,” Old Joe asserted. “For Dick.”</p>

<p>“Dick, he——”</p>

<p>“He make Old Joe promise.”</p>

<p>“But I thought——”</p>

<p>“You thought I did not care,” said the boy. “And
yet you had snatched me from beneath the hoofs of a
herd of cattle.”</p>

<p>“Which was no more than a fair return for the
times that you kept Old Joe from letting daylight
through me.”</p>

<p>“Joe thought he would be doing me a favor; that
was why he tried to shoot you twice.”</p>

<p>“Merriwell,” said Carson, “it strikes me that you
have your baseball-team.”</p>

<p>“Right!” exclaimed Hodge. “Now we’ll take some
of the conceit out of the Denver Reds.”</p>

<p>“I have not played the game since I left you last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
year,” said Swiftwing. “I shall be entirely out of
practise.”</p>

<p>“We have time to get into practise some,” Merry
explained. “We’ll try to do so without delay. Where
is the White Dove, Swiftwing?”</p>

<p>“She became tired of our life, far from the friends
she had known,” explained the young Indian. “It is
not strange, for she has the blood of the white man
in her veins. I saw she was getting restless and unhappy.
At first she would not tell me why, but I
discovered her secret. Then I sent her back to Badger’s
ranch, where she shall stay till she wants to come
to me again.”</p>

<p>“And you,” said Frank, smiling a little, “despite
your resolve to become a hermit and mingle no more
with men, I rather fancy you fell to longing for the
excitement of the diamond and the tumult of the
gridiron. Is it not true, John?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think of it,” the young Indian confessed.
“It is like nothing else, and once a man has
played the games and loved them, he may never quite
forget.”</p>

<p>“That’s the truth,” nodded Carson.</p>

<p>They took the elevator and went up to Merry’s
room, Frank insisting that Crowfoot should come
along. Old Joe would not have accompanied them,
however, had not Dick urged him to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“Smoke?” questioned the wrinkled Indian, as soon
as he was inside Merriwell’s handsomely furnished
suite, which was one of the best in the hotel.</p>

<p>“As much as you like,” nodded Merry, flinging
wide open a window.</p>

<p>The old savage gravely squatted on the floor, bringing
forth his long black pipe and filling it with tobacco.
When he had lighted it he sat there, puffing
away in silence, while the others talked.</p>

<p>Of course, there was much to talk about, and the
conversation was moving briskly when Ready and
Rattleton drifted in. Jack struck a pose when his
eyes fell on Swiftwing.</p>

<p>“What is this I behold?” he cried dramatically. “Is
it my noble friend of the war-path? Whoop! It is!
It are! It am! Come to me arms, my noble ghost-dancer,
and let me fold you, like a long-lost brother,
in a fond embrace.”</p>

<p>Then he pranced forward and clasped the hand
which Swiftwing gravely submitted. The young Indian
was accustomed to the exuberant ways of Ready,
and took no offense.</p>

<p>“And here is that gentle young gazelle, Joseph Crowfoot,
Esquire,” said Ready, making a grand bow.
“Chief, I salute you.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Old Joe, as he continued smoking,
without paying any further attention to Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>Then Ready saw Carson, rubbed his eyes, looked
again, pinched himself, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Ho! ha! Also he! he! Likewise ho! ho! This
is another jolly little surprise. Here is me old side-partner,
the cow-puncher! Pard, this is a sight for
lame eyes! You dear old maverick, how is your general
health?”</p>

<p>“It’s first-class, Ready,” laughed Berlin, as he shook
hands with Jack. “I don’t think it ever was better.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that perfectly lovely!” gurgled Ready. “You
have happened along just in time to get into the round-up.
In the words of the poet, ‘What, oh, what, is so
jolly as the sight of a bosom friend whom you can
touch for a beautiful green bank-note?’ I may want to
borrow a dollar or ten to-morrow, Carson.”</p>

<p>“When did you gind this fang—I mean, find this
gang?” asked Rattleton of Frank.</p>

<p>“Swiftwing, Crowfoot, and Carson happened
along,” Merry explained. “It’s dead lucky for us, as
we have been challenged by the Denver Reds to play
ball, and we were two men short.”</p>

<p>Rattleton had met Swiftwing, and he shook hands
with the young Indian, while Ready was chattering
away to Carson. Then he grasped the hand of the
young college man.</p>

<p>Soon the door opened to admit Gamp, Browning,
and Carker, who, of course, were equally surprised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“Gug-gug-gashfry!” laughed the New Hampshire
youth. “This is just like old tut-tut-times!”</p>

<p>“Trouble! trouble!” murmured Browning wearily.
“I scent baseball in the air, and that means my finish.
I’ll melt and run into a grease-spot during this hot
weather.”</p>

<p>“Baseball, at best,” said Carker, “is a rather cruel
sport in many ways. It is the triumph of the weak
over the strong, which is a sad thing to contemplate
under any circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Merriwell, lifting his hand. “Be still,
everybody!”</p>

<p>They obeyed, and, after a moment, Rattleton asked:</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“I fancied I heard the rumble of Carker’s pet earthquake,”
answered Merry gravely.</p>

<p>Greg flushed, then exclaimed:</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Merry; but the time is coming
when you will hear and feel something more than a
distant rumbling and a faint tremor. The time is
coming when——”</p>

<p>“Will—you—let—up!” shouted Greg’s college
friends, in unison, and the ardent young Socialist relapsed
into despairing silence.</p>

<small>THE NINE AT PRACTISE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The following morning the principal Denver newspaper
contained the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">“FRANK MERRIWELL ACCEPTS.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Editor.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: While reading your paper yesterday I
was somewhat surprised to see the challenge of Mr.
David Morley, manager of the Denver Reds. While
it is true that I have a number of my friends with me
at the present time and have contemplated playing ball,
it is not true that I have taken special pains to pick a
nine, or that I have publicly expressed an intention of
‘wiping up the earth with everything I can find west
of the Mississippi.’ It seems to me that Mr. Morley’s
challenge is couched in language that is not only offensive,
but is likewise insulting. My ball-team has
not played together this season, and therefore is not in
its best form. Nevertheless, I am willing to meet the
Reds, and we will do our best to make the game interesting.
As we are out for sport and not to make
money, I decline to play the game for a special purse;
but I am willing to make an agreement that the winning
team shall take the entire gate-receipts.</p>

<p class="right">“Yours truly,  <span class="gap">    <span class="smcap">Frank Merriwell</span></span>.</p>

<p>“Hotel Metropole.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>As it was necessary for Merry’s team to get some
practise without delay, Frank secured the privilege
of using the principal ball-field of the city that afternoon.</p>

<p>In the forenoon the entire team appeared at a
tailor’s, and the men were measured for suits.</p>

<p>At two o’clock in the afternoon the boys appeared
on the field in order to get some practise, having
bought bats, balls, gloves, mitts, and other necessary
articles.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that Dick Merriwell went
along. Old Joe Crowfoot, however, had disappeared
the previous night, and had not been seen since.</p>

<p>It was not thought that they would be troubled
with spectators, as pains had been taken not to let it
become known that they thought of practising at that
time.</p>

<p>Dick took a seat on the bleachers, where he intended
to remain and watch the practise.</p>

<p>Frank put his men onto the field, with Swiftwing
in left, Gamp center, and Carker right. Of course,
Browning, apparently too weary to move, was detailed
to cover first bag. In the old days Rattleton had
made a very satisfactory man on second, and Merry
placed him there again, while Ready was planted near
third. Carson was a good infield man at any point,
and Merry made him short-stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>Then Bart and Frank started in to give the men
some work by batting out to them, Merry having the
infield and Bart batting to the outfield.</p>

<p>This was the simplest form of practise, but it was
good work to start with, and soon the men were hard
at it, although they could not do as well as they might
had they been in regular uniforms.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid of getting the crease out of your
trousers, Rattles, old man,” called Ready. “Tailors
are hard-working and industrious people, and they
must have business. Besides, we’ve got to hump ourselves
if we shave any frozen liquid in that little game
with the redoubtable Reds. Yea, verily!”</p>

<p>They went into it in earnest, although it quickly
became apparent that practise was sadly needed.
Frank gave them all kinds of balls to handle, hot
grounders, skippers, slow bunts, high flies, little pops,
and liners.</p>

<p>“Ready!” he called, and out to Jack he drove a
slasher along the third-base line, making the fielder by
that bag jump and stretch for it.</p>

<p>Jack cuffed it with one hand, stopped it, fumbled it,
got it up, and lined it across to first. But the throw
was bad.</p>

<p>“That stop was all right,” said Frank, “and you
would have had time to get the man after your fumble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
if you’d made a good throw. Lots of games are
lost by bad infield throwing. Try it again.”</p>

<p>By that time the ball had been thrown in to him,
and he again sent it skimming the ground toward
third.</p>

<p>Ready set his teeth, got squarely in front of it by
a hard dive, stopped it, but did not pick it up cleanly,
fumbled a little, and then made a beautiful line throw
across to first.</p>

<p>With one foot on the bag, Browning lazily smothered
the ball in his big mitt.</p>

<p>“That was better,” commented Frank, “but it wasn’t
perfect. Try another.”</p>

<p>And again he drove a “daisy-clipper” toward Jack,
though not directly at him. This time Ready scooped
up the ball, turned like a flash, and made a fine throw
to first.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” declared Frank approvingly.
“Now you are doing it handsomely.”</p>

<p>He kept the others at it in the same manner, never
letting up on a man till he did his work right. He
had studied the temperament of each individual man,
and some he praised, while others he criticized, though
both praise and criticism were of the kind to be most
effective without harming the player.</p>

<p>Rattleton had not been playing ball for some time,
and two failures to pick up hard grounders seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
take the confidence out of him, for he muttered, loud
enough for Carson to hear:</p>

<p>“I’m afraid my ball-playing is about over. I’m not
in it any more. I feel like ficking myself over the
kence—I mean, kicking myself over the fence.”</p>

<p>He had not intended that Frank should hear, but
Merry’s keen ears caught the words. Immediately
Frank divined that Rattleton had lost confidence, and
he decided at once that it must be restored. Then he
batted a comparatively easy one straight at the second-baseman,
who managed to get it and send it to first.</p>

<p>“Why, you can’t help doing it right when you get
into gear, Rattleton!” laughed Merriwell. “It’s just as
natural for you as it is to talk backwards.”</p>

<p>Harry knew the ball had been easy to get, but these
words seemed to indicate that Frank had confidence in
him, and that served to restore his own confidence.
In a few minutes he was working much better, and
he soon went after the balls as if he felt sure of getting
them.</p>

<p>“It isn’t necessary to take a double step to throw,
Carson,” said Frank. “That’s a new trick with you.
You don’t throw that way naturally. When you get
a ball up clean, use the short-arm throw in sending
it over to first, with a step just as the arm swings forward,
putting the weight of your body into the throw.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
That gets the ball away from you without loss of
time.”</p>

<p>Carson’s face was red, but he nodded, saying, good-naturedly:</p>

<p>“I’ll try it, if I can remember.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can remember in practise,” said
Frank, “and what you get in the habit of doing in
practise is what you’ll do in a game. That’s what
hurts lots of men. They fool around in practise, and
it harms them when they come into a game. In practising,
every man must handle himself just as he would
in a game, if he wishes for the best results.”</p>

<p>When Browning betrayed a disinclination to
“stretch” for balls that were thrown wide, Frank immediately
opened on him sharply. He did not do so
in a jollying way, knowing jollying would not awaken
the big fellow to his best, but spoke in earnest.</p>

<p>“I’d lick any other man for that,” muttered Bruce
to himself; “but, as long as it’s Merriwell, I guess I’ll
have to ginger up.”</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>All this served to awaken Dick Merriwell to a
realizing sense of Frank’s supreme authority over men,
and he glowed with pride in his big brother.</p>

<p>Frank was giving close attention to the work of
the infield, and so he did not observe much that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
taking place in the outfield. After a while, however,
Bart came close and said, in a low tone:</p>

<p>“It’s no use, Merriwell; the Indian has lost his cunning.
He hasn’t made more than one decent catch
thus far, and he’ll be just about as good as a ten-year-old
kid in that field.”</p>

<p>Merry was somewhat surprised by Bart’s words, for
Swiftwing had been a good man in days gone by.
True, he was a better pitcher than outfielder, but he
had demonstrated more than once that he could do
good work in the field. Immediately Frank said:</p>

<p>“Change round. I’ll bat to the outfield a while.”</p>

<p>He drove the first ball out to Carker. It was an
easy fly, and Greg gathered it in without trouble.</p>

<p>Then Frank gave Gamp one that made the long-legged
New Hampshire youth cover ground to the
best of his ability; but Gamp was in form, and he
pulled the ball down after his long run.</p>

<p>It was Swiftwing’s turn. Merry put up an easy
one, but he refrained from driving it directly at the
Indian, knowing many fielders will miss a ball when
nervous if they have to stand still and wait for it,
although they will catch it when they have to make
a brisk move to get under it.</p>

<p>Swiftwing got under the ball, but he did not hold it.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t drop another one if you tried to,”
cried Frank, in a manner and tone that indicated his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
firm belief in his own words. Then he proceeded to
drive another out to the young Indian.</p>

<p>Swiftwing got under it, but again the ball bounced
out of his hands. This time, however, he made a
leap for it, and caught it before it fell to the ground.</p>

<p>“That’s what I told you!” laughed Frank. “I knew
you couldn’t drop the ball, old man. It’s no use for
any old ball to try to get away from you.”</p>

<p>He made Swiftwing believe it, and from that time
on the Indian steadily improved, so that, before long,
he was catching everything any one could reasonably
expect him to hold. Hodge was astonished.</p>

<p>“How the dickens do you do it?” he asked. “You
have a way of making a man do his best.”</p>

<p>Frank smiled.</p>

<p>“Few men do their best unless encouraged,” he
said; “but all men cannot be encouraged in the same
way.”</p>

<p>The main secret of Merriwell’s success in handling
men was that he brought out the very best that was
in them. Had Bart paused to think about this he
would have known it was true, for Frank had developed
in Hodge all the best qualities of the latter.</p>

<p>Frank directed Bart to fling aside his bat and put
on his big catching-mitt. Then Merry batted to both
infield and outfield, directing the throwing of each
man. The throwing-practise was sharp and fairly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
good. Hodge overthrew second the first time he
sent the ball down, but after that he sent the ball
straight as a rifle-bullet.</p>

<p>“Runner on first and second!” called Frank.
“Double play!”</p>

<p>He drove the ball to short, and Carson picked it
up, snapped it to third, upon which Ready drove it
to second in beautiful style.</p>

<p>“Sure double,” said Merriwell. “Runner on first,
one man out, two strikes on the batter. Double ’em
up.”</p>

<p>Down between first and second bounded the ball.
Rattleton went out for it, his teeth set, and took it
successfully. Then he wheeled and jerked it back
to second. Carson had covered second when he saw
Rattleton start after the ball, and he took the throw.
The ball did not linger in his hands, but went whistling
to first, where Browning smothered it.</p>

<p>“No mistake about that,” asserted Frank. “The
swiftest runner in the country could not have made
first on that.”</p>

<p>It was amazing how those fellows improved in a
short time under Merriwell’s direction. Frank called
them in, one at a time, to get batting-practise, Hodge
putting on cage and body-protector.</p>

<p>“Come out here, Dick,” said Frank. “I want you
to throw some, while I coach the batters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>This call had been unexpected by the boy, and he
hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Browning, who was the first
batter; “give us something easy.”</p>

<p>Immediately Dick left the bleachers and entered
the diamond, his eyes flashing and his lips pressed
together.</p>

<p>“Don’t strike him out, Dick,” adjured Merry, as
he tossed the ball to the lad. “He’d feel bad if you
did.”</p>

<p>“No danger,” grunted Browning. “The outfielders
better move back.”</p>

<p>Frank went up behind the catcher, announcing that
he would act as umpire and coach.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell had tossed aside his jacket as he
entered the diamond. His shoulders and arms were
fairly good for a boy of his age, although they might
have been developed more.</p>

<p>“Give your signals,” called the boy to Bart.</p>

<p>Frank had been teaching him to pitch by catcher’s
signals.</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t need to bother about that,” said
Browning.</p>

<p>The words of the big fellow seemed to put the boy
on his mettle. Hodge called for an out, and Dick
delivered it quickly. Browning was not looking for
a curve, and he swung at it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>He did not touch it.</p>

<p>“One strike!” laughed Frank. “At least, he fooled
you once.”</p>

<p>“Why, the young rascal has a curve!” exclaimed
Bruce, in surprise. “I thought he had never seen a
game.”</p>

<p>“He never has.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say——”</p>

<p>“It’s a fact, but he has been practising some.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, one curve is pretty good for a boy like
him; but he’ll never fool me with it again.”</p>

<p>Bart called for an in, and the boy nodded.</p>

<p>Then Dick swung out with all the speed he could
command, which was excellent for a lad of his age.
The ball seemed coming straight over, and Bruce
fancied it must be a straight one this time. He
slashed at it hard, but the ball took a sharp in shoot,
and he fanned again.</p>

<p>“Is it possible!” laughed Frank. “Now, wouldn’t
it be awful if it really did happen that—— But I
won’t speak of it.”</p>

<p>“Confound him!” growled the big Yale graduate.
“He has two curves! You must have found him an
apt pupil, Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“Not at first; but he is coming into it all right.”</p>

<p>“I should guess yes! But I fancy his stock of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
tricks is exhausted now. I’ll just have to line it
out.”</p>

<p>Hodge signaled for another in, but Dick shook his
head. He also shook his head on being given a signal
for an out, but nodded when Bart called for a drop.</p>

<p>Then the boy threw a ball that seemed a very pretty
one to Bruce, but it suddenly dropped toward the
ground, just when the big fellow swung the bat, and
he missed it for the third time.</p>

<p>“Struck him out, Dick!” said Frank, smiling. “I
knew you could do it.”</p>

<p>“Struck me out, by thunder!” rumbled Bruce, his
face crimson. “Struck out by a kid like that!”</p>

<p>He seemed to be greatly cut up over it, but Merry
was highly satisfied.</p>

<p>“He struck you out, for one reason, because you
were too confident, Browning,” said Frank. “You
thought you were dead sure to hit a little chap like
that. It is this same overconfidence that sometimes
makes a good batter strike out. A heady pitcher
often gives a good batter the impression that it is
easy to get hits off him, doing it for the very purpose
of fooling the batter. There are lots of tricks in
pitching besides throwing curves. Change of speed
is necessary. Then a pitcher may often fool a batter
by appearing to have no control over the ball. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
batter thinks he is sure of getting a base on balls,
and he waits, throwing away his chances.”</p>

<p>Then Merry directed Dick to give Bruce some
good straight ones, instructing the big fellow to swing
to meet the ball, and not to “kill it.”</p>

<p>“It’s the first duty of every batter to get his eye
on the ball,” said Frank. “If he stands up and slashes
away with all his strength, he seldom succeeds in
this. Slashing is what spoils many good men who
might become skilful batters.”</p>

<p>Browning had a reputation as a “home-run hitter,”
and no home-run hitter is ever a sure hitter. It’s the
man who meets the ball cleverly and places it for
singles who is the most valuable. Of course, there
are times when home-run hitting counts, and it always
enthuses the spectators; but the man who tries
for nothing save long hits does not obtain the best
results.</p>

<p>Coached by Frank, Browning met the ball handsomely
several times, and then was sent out to his
base, Ready being called in.</p>

<p>“I suppose I’m the only real thing that never fans,”
chirped the apple-cheeked fellow.</p>

<p>Frank looked at Dick and nodded. Bart gave his
signals, and Jack began to fan at once, missing the
first two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“Oh, Laura!” he exclaimed. “How did it happen?
But I always do that to fool the pitcher. Then
I put the next one over the fence.”</p>

<p>The next one, however, was a high in shoot, and
he was completely deceived, as Browning had been.</p>

<p>“Look here, Richard, my son,” said Ready; “you’re
altogether too flip! Is this the way you treat your
trusting friends?”</p>

<p>The boy showed his teeth in a smile that was very
attractive, illuminating his entire face. That face
was a most expressive one, betraying his suddenly
shifting emotions.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to teach him to work the batter with his
looks,” said Frank. “There is something in it. A
pitcher who looks intensely savage sometimes impresses
the batter as dangerous. The pitcher who
wears a cool, disdainful smile is liable to provoke the
batter so that he cannot locate the ball. There are
all sorts of tricks in this business.”</p>

<p>Then Frank began coaching Jack about his striking,
causing him to stand up and step straight out
toward the pitcher with one foot when he swung at
the ball, instead of swinging the foot back and partly
behind him, which is a very bad fault, as it weakens
the batter’s position and spoils his ability to drive
out sure hits.</p>

<p>When a shrewd pitcher finds a man is given to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
stepping back or pulling away from the plate, he is
pretty sure to “keep ’em in close,” which will drive
the batter back right along.</p>

<p>One after another the members of the team came
in and took their turn at bat, and Merriwell’s instructions
were obeyed implicitly. All were surprised
by the skill displayed by Dick, and it was the universal
opinion that the boy had the making of a pitcher
in him.</p>

<p>Indeed, Dick had accomplished much in the short
time he had been at it; but he was the brother of
Frank Merriwell, and the same sort of perseverance
and determination dwelt in his breast.</p>

<p>When Frank was satisfied that Dick had thrown
enough, he took the lad out and went into the box
himself.</p>

<p>At this point, before Merry had delivered a ball,
several persons entered the grounds by the gate. One
seemed to be an old man with gray whiskers, while
two of the others were Black Elrich and the man
who had first caught the big dog by the collar in the
Hotel Metropole.</p>

<p>Elrich was at the head of the party, and he advanced
straight toward the diamond. As he drew
near, he loudly said:</p>

<p>“So this is your team, Merriwell? I’m glad I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
found you here. I’ve brought Dave Morley, manager
of the Reds, along. This is Mr. Morley.”</p>

<p>A short, stout, thick-set man came forward. He
had a smooth-shaven face of the bulldog cast, and
he was smoking a black cigar. His first words were:</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell, I see you are a squealer.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI.<br>

<small>A DESPERATE ATTEMPT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The man’s manner was quite as offensive as his
words, but Merry looked at him calmly, betraying no
emotion, as he asked:</p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“Your acceptance of my challenge was a squeal,”
declared Morley.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“My challenge was to play for a purse and the entire
gate-money.”</p>

<p>“And I accepted, stating my reasons for declining
to play for a purse.”</p>

<p>“Which was a squeal.”</p>

<p>“Which was nothing of the sort! I have not started
out with the intention of running this ball-team to
make money. We are out for sport, and nothing
else. I am not a gambler, and I take no satisfaction
in playing ball for purses.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t suppose you ever did such a thing in
your life?” sneered Morley.</p>

<p>Merry flushed.</p>

<p>“It makes no difference what I have done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“But you can’t deny that you have played for
purses.”</p>

<p>“Never without protest—never unless practically
forced to do so. In this case, I refuse to be forced.
The gate-money should be sufficient to pay well the
winning team.”</p>

<p>“My team is run under heavy expense, and there
is no assurance that your aggregation of amateurs
will prove a drawing card.”</p>

<p>Hodge was at Frank’s elbow, scowling like a
thundercloud, his heart filled with hot anger over the
insolent words of the man. Bart’s fighting blood was
being stirred, and he longed to give Mr. David Morley
just what he deserved.</p>

<p>“Then you have the privilege of declining to meet
us,” said Frank. “That will settle the whole matter
in short order.”</p>

<p>“He knows we’ll draw!” exclaimed Hodge. “Your
name alone, Merriwell, will turn out a crowd.”</p>

<p>“I think you are mistaken,” said the manager of
the Reds. “In the East, Frank Merriwell may be regarded
as something of a wonder, but out here he does
not count. We have plenty of better men.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you——” began Bart hotly.</p>

<p>“Ah!” grunted Morley; “at least this member of
your team is not adverse to making a little gamble,
Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“That has nothing to do with him,” said Bart.
“I’ll bet you ten dollars we get more hits off your
pitcher than you do off Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“Ten dollars!” came scornfully from the manager
of the Denver team. “Why don’t you make it ten
cents? You’re putting the figures too high, young
man.”</p>

<p>His words and manner were calculated to enrage
Bart still more. Frank’s fingers fell with a firm grip
on the arm of his friend, and he quietly said:</p>

<p>“I do not think we’ll do any betting over the game.
If you wish to play us on the terms stated by me in
my acceptance of your challenge, well and good. If
you do not, we’ll let the matter drop.”</p>

<p>“It’s plain enough, Morley,” put in Elrich, “that
the young chap knows which side his bread is buttered
on.”</p>

<p>“He must think me a mark to put my salaried
team against his collection of non-salaried kids,”
sneered the baseball man, “unless there is something
more than glory in it. It’s mighty little glory we’d
get defeating his team.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” exclaimed Bart; “for you’d never
defeat it.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to call the game off,” said Frank,
remaining perfectly calm.</p>

<p>“That’s a shame!” muttered Berlin Carson, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
had heard some of the talk. “I’m a Colorado man,
but I think I know what Merriwell’s team can do,
and——”</p>

<p>“We cuc-cuc-can do those fellows,” said Gamp, who
also was aroused.</p>

<p>“Why, it would be a snap!” chuckled Jack Ready.
“All we wanted the game for was to get a little
practise.”</p>

<p>“You’re a lot of bluffers!” roughly declared Morley.</p>

<p>“I told you there was nothing in it, Dave,” said
Elrich, with an air of weariness. “The boys have
not money enough to put up a purse.”</p>

<p>Then Frank felt some one tugging at his elbow,
and he looked round to see Dick there, his eyes gleaming
and his face flushed with indignation.</p>

<p>“Bet him, Frank!” palpitated the lad. “I wouldn’t
stand it to have him talk that way to me! You know
father was dreadfully rich, and all his money was
left to us. I’ll bet every cent of my part that your
team can beat his!”</p>

<p>“Ho! ho!” laughed Morley. “And how much might
your part be, kid?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a little trifle of eight or ten million dollars,
that’s all,” said Frank, who could not help being somewhat
nettled by the insulting manner of the man. “I
think it would be quite enough to accommodate you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
in case it was staked against anything you could raise
at twenty to one.”</p>

<p>It was not often Merriwell said anything like this,
but just now he had been provoked to the limit, and
he could not refrain.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say the kid is worth eight or
ten million dollars, do you?” asked Elrich, as if incredulous.</p>

<p>“He will inherit something like that amount when
he comes of age,” answered Merry, as he carelessly
toyed with the ball he had held throughout this conversation.</p>

<p>A swift look passed between Elrich and the man
with the gray whiskers, who stood slightly apart from
the group.</p>

<p>“And you’re his brother?” Elrich questioned further.</p>

<p>“I am,” bowed Merry.</p>

<p>“Where do you come in?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“What part of this snug little fortune do you
get?”</p>

<p>“Really, sir, I do not know as that is of any concern
to you. Still, it is no secret that I, also, will
inherit a similar sum when he comes of age.”</p>

<p>“When he does? That’s odd. You’re of age now.
How does it happen that——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>“I decline to speak of this matter further, sir, as
I——”</p>

<p>“You’re a big bluffer, Merriwell. I do not take
any stock in your romance of millions.”</p>

<p>“And I care not a snap whether you do or not.”</p>

<p>“If you had so much money at your command,
you’d not hesitate to put up a few hundred to back
your ball-team—that is, if you really believe your
team capable of playing ball.”</p>

<p>“I have reasons for not gambling in any way,”
said Frank. “I do not expect men like you to respect
my scruples, so all this talk is wasted.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t fool with you!” angrily sneered
Morley. “I’ll bet you five hundred dollars, even
money, that the Denver Reds can defeat your ball-team.
If you will not cover the money, we’ll fool
away no more time.”</p>

<p>“If he will not cover your money, I reckon I will!”
exclaimed a voice, as a man, who had approached
without attracting notice, pushed into the excited
group.</p>

<p>“Father!” exclaimed Berlin Carson.</p>

<p>“Mr. Carson?” came from Merry’s lips.</p>

<p>“That’s me!” nodded the rancher, extending his
hand and giving Merry a hearty grip. “Forgot to
tell Berlin to attend to one little piece of business while
in the city, so I decided to follow him. Heard over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
at the hotel that you were here, Merriwell, with a
ball-team. They told me where to find you, and I
came right out. What sort of a game of talk was
this man giving you?”</p>

<p>“He was trying to force me into wagering money
with him over a ball-game to which he has challenged
me. He is the manager of the Denver Reds.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t often bet against a home team, but
I know you, and I’ve seen your men play ball, so, if
he wants to plank down five hundred, I judge I can
accommodate the gentleman. I believe I have that
amount of money about my clothes.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re the man I’m looking for!” exclaimed
Morley. “Mr. Elrich is my backer, and he will put
up the money.”</p>

<p>“Who’ll hold the stakes?”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Jordan here is a good man to——”</p>

<p>“I allow I don’t know anything about Mr. Jordan,
but I do know Charley Gans, down at the Metropole,
and he’ll suit me to a T.”</p>

<p>“Gans is all right,” nodded Elrich, who seemed
eager to get the bet.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll meet you there at six this evening, and
we’ll put up the dust,” said Mr. Carson, with a dismissing
wave of his hand. “Good day till later.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Dick, flinging his hat into the air.
“That’s the stuff!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“Slang, my boy—slang!” said Ready, severely.
“You’re catching on altogether too quick. I’m afraid
you have been associating with bad company lately.”</p>

<p>“You’re a regular young sport!” said Elrich, with
apparent admiration, his words being intended to flatter
the boy.</p>

<p>“Are you a sport?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Well, I allow I have some sporting blood in me.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m no sport!” the lad quickly asserted. “I
don’t want to be like you.”</p>

<p>Elrich’s smile turned to a frown, but he said:</p>

<p>“You’re pretty sharp with your tongue, but you
may have some of your flipness taken out of you
some day. All the same, I like you, and I’ll give
you a drive back to the hotel in my private carriage,
if you’ll go.”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” said Merry. “He can have all the drives
he likes at his own expense.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well!” said the gambler, turning away
and starting to talk in a low tone to Morley.</p>

<p>Mr. Carson was speaking with those of Frank’s
friends whom he had met before. Now he turned
to Merry once more.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ve got you to thank for getting my
boy onto the Yale ball-team,” he said. “Berlin said
it was through you he got a chance to show what he
could do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“It was because I knew he had the right stuff in
him,” asserted Merriwell. “I presume you’ll let him
play with us against the Denvers?”</p>

<p>“Sure as you’re shouting! And I’ll disown him if
he doesn’t put up a good game.”</p>

<p>At this moment there came a sudden cry. They
turned to see Dick Merriwell, caught up by the man
with the gray beard, being carried swiftly toward the
gate, which was standing open. The man was running,
holding the struggling lad under his arm.</p>

<p>For an instant every one seemed paralyzed with
astonishment. Then Frank Merriwell sprang out,
his arm went back, and, with all his strength, he
threw the ball in his hand.</p>

<p>Straight as a bullet from a rifle flew the ball, and
it struck the running man fairly on the back of the
head, knocking him forward on his face.</p>

<p>This caused him to drop the boy, and, quick as
thought, Dick scrambled up and leaped, like a young
panther, on the back of the man.</p>

<p>When Merriwell leaped forward, Black Elrich suddenly
stepped into his way, and there was a collision.
Elrich staggered and caught hold of Merriwell’s arm,
to which he tried to cling.</p>

<p>Instantly Frank beat off the hand of the man,
sprang round him, and dashed to the aid of Dick.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
But the man had flung the boy off, and now he rose
to his feet, casting one quick look over his shoulder.</p>

<p>A surprising thing had happened, for the man was
beardless now, his gray whiskers being grasped in the
fingers of the plucky lad. Frank saw the face of
the man.</p>

<p>“Mescal!” he cried.</p>

<p>It was Mescal and again he had made a desperate
play to get possession of Dick Merriwell, for Frank
was confident it had been the intention of the fellow to
abduct the boy.</p>

<p>Mescal now fled like a deer out through the gate,
sprang into the carriage standing there, tore the reins
from the hands of the driver, snatched out the whip,
cut the horses, and was carried away just as Frank
came up.</p>

<p>For a moment Merry contemplated pursuing the
desperado, but he quickly decided that it would be
folly to make the attempt.</p>

<p>Black Elrich came rushing out through the gate,
shouting:</p>

<p>“Stop! stop there! By heavens! he’s running off
with my team!”</p>

<p>Frank faced the gambler, his eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“The job failed, Elrich,” he said cuttingly. “It
was a daring attempt, and rather foolish, I think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>“The man is crazy!” said Black Ben.</p>

<p>“Crazy to make a play for ransom-money,” said
Merry. “I know him, and I’ll see that the police of
Denver are put on his track. If he is caught, he may
squeal and expose his pals. In that case, Mr. Elrich,
you are liable to feel rather uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to insinuate——”</p>

<p>“My words are plain. I saw the look that passed
between you and that man a short time ago. My
eyes are pretty wide open.”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know the man. He came along to
the gate as we were entering, and walked in with
us.”</p>

<p>“By appointment?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort! I tell you I don’t know
him. And anybody who knows me will swear that
my word is good.”</p>

<p>“In a matter of cards or other gambling it may
be. But I wish you to inform Anton Mescal that I
shall be better prepared for him next time. The
ball that brings him down then will be of lead, and
not a common baseball.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII.<br>

<small>A DASTARDLY TRICK.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Frank went directly from the ball-grounds to police
headquarters, where he told of the attempted abduction
of Dick, giving a full description of Anton
Mescal, and entering complaint against the man. The
police fancied Mescal was an old offender under another
name, and promised to do their best to lay hands
on him.</p>

<p>When Merry reached the Hotel Metropole he found
that something had happened. Mr. Carson had again
encountered Black Elrich, who had expressed a doubt
concerning his sincerity in the assertion that he would
back Merry’s ball-team. As a result, Carson had deposited
the money at once, and Elrich had covered it,
with the understanding that the game was to take
place within two days.</p>

<p>“Two days!” exclaimed Frank, as the cattleman
reached this point in his report of what had taken
place.</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Carson. “He said he would not
object if you wished to play to-morrow, but would
prefer that the game take place on the day following.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>“And you put the money up under such conditions?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“The first trick!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“He knows my team has not played together yet
this summer, and has not obtained much practise.
He wished to get the game before we could put ourselves
in the best condition.”</p>

<p>“Why, he led me to believe that you wished to play
to-morrow, but that he wanted another day for advertising-purposes.”</p>

<p>“Which was his way of working the trick. Never
mind, Mr. Carson; we’ll meet him.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll beat him,” put in Hodge.</p>

<p>“In that case, he will lose a good round sum of
money,” said the cattleman.</p>

<p>“Five hundred does not seem much to a man like
him,” said Bart.</p>

<p>“But five hundred is far from being all he will lose.
It’s the smallest part.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Why, another gambler happened to be present,
and he seemed to know something about you. When
I had covered Elrich’s money, this other man asked
me if I was dead sure that the fellow who was going
to pitch against the Reds was Frank Merriwell, of
Yale. I told him I was. He wanted to know how I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
was sure. I explained that my son attended Yale,
and would play with Merriwell’s team. Then what do
you suppose happened?”</p>

<p>“Go on,” urged Merry.</p>

<p>“This man turned on Elrich and offered to bet all
sorts of money on you, Merriwell. He said he would
bet a thousand dollars even that you struck out no less
than eighteen men. Elrich took him, and the money
went up. Then he offered another thousand dollars
even that the Reds would not get more than five hits
off you. Elrich took that.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Frank, while Bart Hodge simply
said:</p>

<p>“He’ll win.”</p>

<p>“When the second bet had been covered, the man
offered to put up one thousand against two thousand
that the Reds did not score at all.”</p>

<p>“And the offer was taken?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Bart actually laughed.</p>

<p>“Whoever he is, that man knows you, Merry.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Mr. Carson, “he offered a bet of two
thousand to one that the Reds would be beaten, and
that wager was taken.”</p>

<p>“Five thousand dollars each!” exclaimed Frank.
“That is big money on a ball-game.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“Who was the man?” asked Hodge. “Didn’t you
find out, Mr. Carson?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I was curious to know, and it seemed
that he was no stranger to Elrich. They had met
before, and Elrich called him Lake.”</p>

<p>“Lake?” said Frank. “I do not think I have a
friend by that name.”</p>

<p>“I asked Charley Gans, the stakeholder, about him,”
said the cattleman, “and he said the man was a race-track
gambler, and that his full name was Justin
Lake.”</p>

<p>“Justin Lake?” cried both Frank and Bart.</p>

<p>“That was his name,” nodded Mr. Carson.</p>

<p>“Well, that beats anything,” came from Hodge.
“To think he’d bet on you, Frank!”</p>

<p>Merry laughed.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he did it to recoup, for he has lost enough
in his time betting against me.”</p>

<p>“Then you know him?” questioned Mr. Carson.</p>

<p>“I should say so. I have had two very serious encounters
with the fellow, who is just as much a rascal
as Black Elrich. Last year he plotted against Yale
and bet money on her defeat, but I baffled his plots.
Again this year he tried the trick, carrying me out to
sea on his steam-yacht, where he originally meant to
leave me in an open boat, so that I would not be on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
hand at the New London boat-race. But once more I
defeated him, and he lost a large amount of money.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s betting on you this time, and he finally
had Elrich at a stand, for he proposed several other
wagers, which the man would not accept. He also
asked me if Hodge was to catch in the game. I told
him so, and, finding he could get no more bets, he
politely called Elrich a mark. He declared that, with
Hodge catching, there was no possible show for any
team outside the big leagues to defeat you. Some
reference was made to your ball called the double-shoot.
Elrich sneered and laughed at it. Lake said
you could throw the double-shoot, but that there was
no other catcher, save Hodge, who could hold it well.”</p>

<p>“Compliment from a rascal!” said Bart. “No thanks
for it.”</p>

<p>“I hate to help Justin Lake to make a winning,”
said Frank; “but it can’t be helped now. There is
no way out of it.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll agree to take something out of his hide in
case I meet him,” Hodge declared. “I’ve been wanting
to get my hands on him for some time.”</p>

<p>Lake, however, was not found around the hotel.</p>

<p>The story of the great betting on the ball-game
that was to take place within two days spread swiftly
through the city, so that it became the talk in sporting
circles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>Frank was very sorry that anything of the sort
had happened, but still his conscience was clear, as
he had rigidly refused to be driven into wagering
money with a man like Elrich. When the other
members of Frank’s team heard about it, they all expressed
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s the greatest ad we could have had!”
laughed Jack Ready. “I’ll wager my loveliest pair
of drop-stitch hose that we draw the biggest crowd
ever seen at a ball-game in this city. And how I
will surprise the populace. La! la!”</p>

<p>“Jiminy!” gurgled Gamp. “Th-th-th-things are
beginning to git lively right off!”</p>

<p>“Money! money!” sighed Carker, shaking his head
dolefully. “It is the root of all evil! It stirs up contention
and strife! It arouses greed and envy! Ah,
will the day ever come when all men shall be equally
rich and equally poor?”</p>

<p>“Lot on your knife—I mean not on your life!” exclaimed
Rattleton promptly.</p>

<p>That evening Hodge and Ready were walking along
one of the principal streets of the city when an old
woman stopped them at a corner, croaking:</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen, I can tell your past and future.
I am Gipsy Mag, the seventh daughter of a seventh
daughter. Let me read your palms, and all the mysteries
of your lives shall be revealed to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>“Tell me, pretty maiden, are there any more at
home like you?” warbled Ready.</p>

<p>“I have no home,” she answered. “My home is
the whole world. For a quarter I will reveal to you
many things.”</p>

<p>“That’s cheap enough,” nodded Jack. “Here is
your fourth part of an honest American dollar. Now,
go ahead and tell me lots of lovely things.”</p>

<p>The old woman’s eyes were fastened on Bart.</p>

<p>“Let me tell his fortune first,” she urged.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Hodge. “I do not care
for it.”</p>

<p>“It’s a mash, old man,” chuckled Ready. “You’ve
hit her hard, my boy. If you don’t submit to her demands,
I’ll tell the gang about your mash. Put up
your fin and let the fair lady read your palm. Come
on.”</p>

<p>He playfully grasped Bart’s wrist and held up his
hand for the old fortune-teller to examine.</p>

<p>Not wishing to appear grouty, Hodge submitted.</p>

<p>The old woman firmly grasped the back of Bart’s
hand, over which she bent, mumbling something. Then
of a sudden she poured from a small vial something
upon Hodge’s hand that immediately began to smart
and burn like fire.</p>

<p>Bart gave an exclamation of surprise and anger,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
snatching his hand away. The old woman flung aside
the vial.</p>

<p>“It’s the oil of success!” she cried. “Hereafter you
will succeed in everything you undertake.”</p>

<p>“It’s a trick!” exclaimed Hodge hoarsely. “The
stuff burns.”</p>

<p>“That will stop in a moment,” laughed the gipsy.
“It will do you good.”</p>

<p>“Grab her, Jack!” exclaimed Bart. “She has done
something to put my hand out of commission.”</p>

<p>But the old woman turned and ran with surprising
speed through a doorway and disappeared into a saloon.
Ready jumped after her, but, as he entered the
saloon by one door, he saw her disappear through another
that led onto a side street. He rushed after
her, but she had vanished when he reached the street.</p>

<p>“Well, by the powers!” gasped Jack. “She’s vanished
like a witch!”</p>

<p>When he returned to the point where he had left
Bart, he saw the latter just disappearing into a drug
store. Jack hurried after. As he entered, he heard
Hodge saying to the druggist:</p>

<p>“An old woman threw something on my hand that
burns like fire. I believe it was acid. Give me
something quick to relieve me.”</p>

<p>The druggist sprang to obey, after taking a single
look at Bart’s hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“Vitriol, or something like it,” declared the druggist,
as he quickly applied to the hand something
to soothe it. “But it’s queer she threw it on your
hand. Vitriol-throwers usually aim at the face.”</p>

<p>Bart saw Jack at his side.</p>

<p>“Did you catch her?” he eagerly asked, although
it was plain from the expression of his face that he
was in pain.</p>

<p>“She got away,” confessed Ready humbly. “Hodge,
I’m to blame for this! I’m a chump—a blundering
chump!”</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for you——” began Bart, but
he suddenly checked himself, controlling the impulse
to reproach his companion for what had happened.</p>

<p>“I know—I know!” muttered Ready. “Oh, I’d
like to kick myself! But who ever thought that old
hag was up to anything of the kind?”</p>

<p>“Why did she do it?” asked the druggist, as he
continued to apply the lotion to Bart’s hand.</p>

<p>“That’s a mystery,” said Ready.</p>

<p>“No mystery at all,” said Hodge, at once. “It
was so that I may be unable to catch in the game
against the Reds. That was the trick. With a raw
hand like this, I’ll be knocked out. And I know
the miserable gambler who is behind the whole deal.
His name is Black Elrich!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>

<small>ON THE FIELD.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>No baseball-game in Denver had ever turned out
a larger crowd. The story of the betting had been
told by the newspapers, and that, together with the
fact that the great college man, Merriwell, was the
manager, captain, and pitcher for the team pitted
against the Reds, served to bring the people swarming
to the ball-grounds.</p>

<p>The story of the strange injury of Bart Hodge had
also been told by the papers, and they had said that
Merriwell could not do his best in the box without
Hodge for a catcher. This being the case, the majority
of the public felt convinced that the Denver team would
win.</p>

<p>Of course, the papers had scouted the idea that
Bart’s hand had been injured to keep him from catching,
even though Hodge himself hotly declared that as
his firm belief. Merriwell, also, believed such to be
the case, as did the other members of the team.</p>

<p>At first it had seemed that the nine was disastrously
crippled, but Hodge had said:</p>

<p>“It’s my left hand. In her haste, the old hag did
not stop to see if it was my throwing-hand. Had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
she put the stuff on my right hand it would have
knocked me out. Now, I am going to catch.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t do it!” exclaimed Rattleton.</p>

<p>“I will!” grated Hodge. “I’ll catch, if it takes my
life!”</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you can’t,” he confessed. “The doctor
says not.”</p>

<p>“Doctors do not know everything.”</p>

<p>“But I’d rather lose the game, and Mr. Carson says
he’d rather lose his money than have you permanently
injure your hand.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not injure it permanently. The catcher’s mitt
will protect it, and I’ll be behind the bat.”</p>

<p>Frank admired this kind of grit, but he feared that
Hodge might find himself seriously handicapped in
the game.</p>

<p>When the afternoon of the game came, Bart got
into his new suit with the others, although his hand
was in a bandage.</p>

<p>The Reds were first to appear on the field, and the
admirers of Denver’s lively independent team rose
up and gave them a warm greeting. They went out
at once for practise, and their work was sharp, snappy,
and professional.</p>

<p>Just as the regular time for the practise of the home
team had expired, Merriwell and his men entered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
field. They made a handsome appearance in their new
suits, with a large white M on the bosom of every
shirt, and the spectators generously gave them a hearty
hand.</p>

<p>“Where’s Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“Where’s Hodge?”</p>

<p>“That’s Hodge with the bandage on his hand.”</p>

<p>“Is he going to catch?”</p>

<p>“He says he will.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he was hurt at all. It was a trick
to fool the Reds.”</p>

<p>“Can’t fool them that way.”</p>

<p>“Merriwell will fool them with his double-shoot.”</p>

<p>“Double-shoot be jiggered! No man ever threw
such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Wait and see.”</p>

<p>Such was the talk on the bleachers.</p>

<p>“Take the field,” said Merry, and the men trotted
out.</p>

<p>Then practise began. Two of the Denver men
batted the balls out, while Bart and Frank made
ready to do some warming up on the side.</p>

<p>The work of the Reds had been almost flawless in
practise, but such could not be said of Merry’s team.
They showed their want of practise, although they
went after everything with a will. Rattleton had not
been playing ball for some time, and he was not used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
to the ground around second, which caused him to
make two bad fumbles of hot grounders.</p>

<p>“He’s a dead one,” declared the crowd.</p>

<p>Out in left field, Swiftwing misjudged the first ball
he went after and failed to touch it when he should
have done so.</p>

<p>“The Indian is no good,” decided the bleachers.</p>

<p>Browning had not aroused himself, and he had a
supremely weary air at first.</p>

<p>“First base is too lazy,” said the spectators.</p>

<p>In this manner almost the entire team was condemned.</p>

<p>Bart had pulled on a mitt and Frank was throwing
him some easy ones. If they hurt Bart’s hand, he
made no show of it; but Merry would be compelled
to use different speed than that in a game.</p>

<p>Black Elrich and Dan Mahoney were sitting on the
bleachers. Mahoney observed:</p>

<p>“It’s a cinch!”</p>

<p>“I think so,” said Elrich.</p>

<p>“No need to have gone to all that trouble about
the catcher,” muttered Mahoney.</p>

<p>“But I wanted to make sure. You know Lake
said he is the only man who can hold Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“You’re five thousand in, with the five hundred
added.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“I reckon. But what’s this? There’s the boy
Mescal was after, and he’s got a companion. Look
at them! What are they going to do?”</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell and Old Joe Crowfoot were advancing
toward the home plate.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX.<br>

<small>HITS THAT DID NOT COUNT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Frank Merriwell made a signal, and his men came
trotting in from the field.</p>

<p>But the eyes of the spectators were on the strangely
handsome boy and the wrinkled old Indian, the latter
having his dirty red blanket wrapped about his shoulders.
At the home plate, to which the boy seemed to
lead the Indian, they stopped.</p>

<p>Some boys on the bleachers began to whoop like a
whole pack of redskins. Unheeding everything, Old
Joe slowly walked round the rubber plate, then stopped,
extended his hands over it and made some queer signs,
as if he were weaving a spell. A hush had fallen on
the curious crowd.</p>

<p>Finally the aged Indian stooped and solemnly placed
the flat of his hand upon the plate, as if blessing it.
This done, he turned, and, accompanied by the boy,
walked toward the bench. Again the urchins began
to whoop, and the crowd laughed.</p>

<p>The umpire appeared and advanced onto the field.
The Reds, of course, had their choice of innings, and
they decided to go to bat first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>Merriwell’s men were bunched about their leader,
who was speaking to them in low tones.</p>

<p>“All ready,” called the umpire.</p>

<p>Immediately, the Merries turned and trotted out
onto the field once more, while the first batter of the
home team picked out his stick and advanced toward
the plate.</p>

<p>“Light on him right off the reel,” said Dave Morley,
who was sitting on the home bench. “Break his
heart in the first inning.”</p>

<p>Frank was in the box, while Bart Hodge adjusted
his mitt behind the plate.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” rang out the voice of the umpire.</p>

<p>Merriwell placed his foot upon the pitcher’s plate
and prepared to deliver the ball. Every man was
ready.</p>

<p>Frank was cautious about using speed at first, and
he tried Jones on a slow drop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>Crack! The bat met the ball, and Jones lifted a
pretty single just over the infield, prancing down to
first like a long-geared race-horse, while the crowd
gave a shout of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“The very first one!” laughed Morley. “Why, I
knew it was a snap!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Umpire,” said Frank quietly, “if that gentleman
is going to make remarks, kindly ask him to leave
the players’ bench.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Morley,” said the umpire, “you will
have to keep still while you are on the bench.”</p>

<p>This caused the crowd to howl derisively, and it
seemed that the Merries had very few friends present.</p>

<p>Davis was ready to strike, and Frank gave him a
wide out drop. He let it pass, and Jones took the opportunity
to hustle for second in an attempt to steal.</p>

<p>Hodge took the ball, did not swing, but seemed to
pull his hand just back to his ear, and then threw
to second. It was a quick, easy throw, and it did not
seem that Bart put enough force into it to send the ball
down.</p>

<p>“Slide!” yelled the coacher.</p>

<p>Jones had been running like a deer, for he was
the best base-stealer on the team, as well as the surest
hitter. Forward he flung himself, sliding gracefully
along the ground with his hands outstretched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>The ball came into Rattleton’s hands about two feet
from the ground, and Harry had it on the runner
when Jones’ hands were yet a foot from the bag.</p>

<p>“Man is out!” announced the umpire.</p>

<p>A hush fell on the crowd, and then somebody started
the clapping, which was rather generous.</p>

<p>“Say, that catcher can throw!” cried a man on the
bleachers. “Bet you don’t steal many bags on him to-day.”</p>

<p>The first man was out, and the Reds had been taught
a lesson they would not fail to profit by. They had
found that Hodge was a beautiful thrower, so that it
was dangerous to try to steal.</p>

<p>“Hard luck, old man,” said several of the players,
as Jones came in. “But he got you, all right.”</p>

<p>“And I thought I had a good start, too,” said Jones.
“I’d bet my shirt I had that bag.”</p>

<p>One ball had been called on Frank. He tried a high
one next time, and another ball was called.</p>

<p>Then Davis fouled, which caused the umpire to call
a strike on him.</p>

<p>“Put another in the same place,” invited the batter.</p>

<p>Frank seemed to accommodate him, and Davis
cracked it out, driving it past Carson, who did not
touch it.</p>

<p>Another base-hit had been made off Merry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>“That’s two of the five!” exclaimed Elrich, in satisfaction.
“When three more are made I’ll have won
one thousand dollars, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Croaker was a heavy hitter. Merry suspected it, and
he tried his arts to pull the fellow, but three balls were
called.</p>

<p>Davis had not attempted to steal, for he remembered
the fate of the man ahead of him, and Merry
held him close to the bag.</p>

<p>It seemed, however, that Frank was certain to give
the next batter a base on balls. He was forced to put
the ball over, which he did.</p>

<p>Mahoney, the captain of the team, had advised the
batter to “play the game,” which prevented him from
striking, although he afterward declared that the ball
came sailing over the plate “as big as a house.”</p>

<p>A strike was called. Frank calmly put another in
the same place, and it was another strike.</p>

<p>Croaker gripped his bat. The coachers warned
Davis to run, as the batter would be out on the third
strike, anyhow, if the first base was occupied.</p>

<p>So, as soon as Merriwell drew back his arm, Davis
started hard for second. The ball was a swift high
one, but Croaker met it and drove it out for a single
that landed Davis on third.</p>

<p>“Here is where we score a hundred!” cried the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
coachers. “Oh, say! is this the wonder we have been
hearing about?”</p>

<p>Hodge called Merry in, and said to him, in a low
tone:</p>

<p>“Speed up!”</p>

<p>“But——” said Frank.</p>

<p>“No buts,” said Bart.</p>

<p>“Your hand.”</p>

<p>“I’ll hold them.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Then they returned to their places.</p>

<p>“Down on the first one,” was the advice of the
coacher near first. “With Davis on third, he’ll never
throw to second.”</p>

<p>Frank sent in a swift in shoot, having compelled
Croaker to keep close to first. Croaker, however, confident
that Bart would not throw to second, scudded
for the bag.</p>

<p>Hodge seemed to throw to Merriwell, and Frank
put up his hands, as if to catch the ball, which had been
thrown high.</p>

<p>Seeing Davis had not started from third, Frank did
not bring his hands together, but let the ball pass between
them over his head. The ball struck the ground
about ten feet from second and bounded straight into
Harry’s waiting hands.</p>

<p>The runner slid, but Harry touched him out, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
then sent the ball whistling home, for, having seen the
ball go over Merry, Davis had started to score.</p>

<p>Davis had been fooled into clinging close to the
base too long. The trick had worked well, for Hodge
had thrown the ball so that Merry could catch it in
case Davis started, but with sufficient force to take it
to second on a long bound, if Merry saw fit to let it go.
Had Davis started, Frank would have caught the ball
and cut him off.</p>

<p>Now, although Davis ran as if his life depended on
the issue, he could not get home in time, and Bart was
waiting for him with the ball.</p>

<p>“Out second and home!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>The spectators gasped, for they had been treated to
a clever piece of work that showed them the Merries
knew a thing or two about baseball.</p>

<p>Three hits had been made by the first three men at
bat, yet the side had been retired without a run,
through the clever work of Hodge, Merriwell, and
Rattleton.</p>

<p>The Reds were disgusted over the result, but Black
Elrich said:</p>

<p>“They can’t keep that up, and Merriwell is fruit for
the Reds. Every man can hit him. Two more hits
mean a cool thousand for me, and there are eight innings
to make them in.”</p>

<p>“They’re going to get twenty off him,” said Dan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
Mahoney. “My brother Pete is the worst hitter in
the bunch, but he can lace that fellow all over the
lot.”</p>

<p>On the bleachers Old Joe Crowfoot was grimly
smoking his pipe, but by his side sat an excited boy,
whose face was flushed and whose eyes shone.</p>

<p>“They didn’t get a run, did they, Joe?” asked the
boy eagerly.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted the Indian. “Don’t know. White
man’s game. Injun don’t know him.”</p>

<p>“But they did hit the ball,” said Dick, in disappointment.
“I didn’t think Frank would let them
do that.”</p>

<p>“He throw um ball pretty quick,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“He’s afraid to do his best, I’m sure,” said Dick.
“He’s afraid Hodge can’t catch it.”</p>

<p>“Hodge he heap big catch,” asserted Crowfoot.
“Not afraid of stick when it swing. Him good.”</p>

<p>“We got out of a bad hole that time, fellows,”
said Frank, as the team gathered at the bench. “If
we keep on playing ball like that we’ll win this game.”</p>

<p>“Those fellows will know better than to chance
such takes—take such chances,” said Rattleton.</p>

<p>“How is your hand, Bart?” asked Merry.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Hodge.</p>

<p>Ready had chosen a bat.</p>

<p>“I’m going to drive the first one over Old Baldy,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
he said, with a motion toward the distant mountains.
But he walked up to the plate and proceeded to strike
out on the first three balls pitched.</p>

<p>“Speed!” he said, as he came back to the bench.
“Whew! That fellow’s got it! They didn’t look
larger than peas as they came over.”</p>

<p>Carson went out and fouled twice, getting strikes
called on him. Then he drove a short one to the
pitcher and was thrown out.</p>

<p>“See if you can’t start the ball rolling, Bruce,” urged
Merry.</p>

<p>Browning, however, did not seem much more than
half-awake, and he, too, fell before the speed and
sharp curves of Park, making the third man.</p>

<p>Favor took his place at the plate, and Merry faced
him in the box. Frank gave the fellow a high one
to start with, but Favor was confident and hit it safely
past Ready.</p>

<p>“Four hits!” counted Elrich exultantly. “One
more gives me a thousand.”</p>

<p>Before the ball could be fielded in Favor had reached
second and was safe.</p>

<p>“Everybody hits him!” shouted a voice from the
bleachers. “Is this the great Frank Merriwell?”</p>

<p>Tears of rage came into Dick Merriwell’s eyes, and
his hands were tightly clenched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>“Why doesn’t he use the double-shoot?” panted the
boy. “He hasn’t tried it once.”</p>

<p>Frank was as calm as ever. Gresham, a stout, solid-looking
chap, grinned tauntingly as he took his place
to strike. Frank tried to pull him, but two balls were
called. Then Merry put one over the corner, and
Gresham batted it down to Ready.</p>

<p>Jack should have handled the ball, but he did not
get it up in time to cut Gresham off at first. Seeing
he was too late, he took no chances of a wild throw,
and did not throw at all.</p>

<p>“Oh, wow! wow!” roared the crowd. “All to pieces!
How easy! how easy!”</p>

<p>Hodge was looking black as a thundercloud. The
game was not pleasing him at all. Was it possible
Frank has lost some of his skill?</p>

<p>Arata, a stocky young Indian, advanced to the
plate. He showed his teeth to Merry, who gave him
a pretty one on the outside corner.</p>

<p>Arata smashed it hard, driving it on a line over
Frank’s head.</p>

<p>Like a flash Merriwell shot into the air and pulled
down the ball with one hand. Like a flash he whirled
round and threw to Rattleton.</p>

<p>As the bat met the ball, both Favor and Gresham
had started to run. They did not realize Merry had
caught the ball until Frank threw to second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>Rattleton took the throw, touched the bag and drove
the ball whistling to first.</p>

<p>Gresham had stopped and was trying to scramble
back to first, but the ball got there ahead of him, being
smothered in Browning’s mitt.</p>

<p>“Batter out!” announced the umpire. “Out second
and first!”</p>

<p>It was a triple play!</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell flung his hat into the air, giving
a shrill yell of joy. The yell was taken up by the
crowd, for this was the sort of ball-playing to delight
the cranks.</p>

<p>The Merries were fast winning friends.</p>

<p>The shout of applause having subsided, somebody
cried:</p>

<p>“Why, you fellows don’t need a pitcher! You can
play the game with any kind of a man in the box!”</p>

<p>Mahoney, the captain of the Reds, was sore, but
he told his men that it would not happen again in a
thousand years.</p>

<p>Gamp was the first hitter of the Merries, and the
long youth from New Hampshire drove the ball out
to Gresham, who made a very pretty catch.</p>

<p>Hodge hit savagely, but his temper was not right
to connect with Park’s curves, and he fanned.</p>

<p>Then came Swiftwing. Again the collection of boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
whooped like a lot of Indians from the bleachers. The
Indian put up an infield fly, and was out.</p>

<p>“Give us the double-shoot at your best speed, Merriwell,”
said Hodge, in a low tone. “Just show these
chumps you can pitch a little.”</p>

<p>“All right,” nodded Frank; “if you can handle it
with that hand, you shall have it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about me,” said Bart.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Dan Mahoney, “you’ll see my brother
get a hit.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Elrich, “for it wins the first thousand
for me.”</p>

<p>Mahoney came to the plate. He had seen others
hitting Frank, and he felt fully confident he could do
so. Merry gave him a swift double-shoot to start with,
and he fanned, gasped, rubbed his eyes and looked
amazed.</p>

<p>“Do that again,” he invited.</p>

<p>Merry did, and again he fanned.</p>

<p>The third one was a slow drop that dragged him,
and he did not hit it. Frank had struck out his first
man.</p>

<p>Park was not much of a hitter, and Merry found
him easy, striking him out quite as easy as he had
Mahoney.</p>

<p>“Those are the weak men!” cried somebody. “Now,
let’s see you do it to Jones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>Being thus invited, Frank sent in his prettiest
double-shoot, and Jones missed the first one.</p>

<p>“Hello!” muttered Jones, as he gripped the bat.
“That was a queer one. If I didn’t know better, I
should say——”</p>

<p>He did not mutter what he should say, for Frank
was ready and another came buzzing past, only the
curves were reversed.</p>

<p>Again Jones bit at it and failed to connect.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s doing it now!” breathed Dick Merriwell,
in delight.</p>

<p>Every ball hurt Bart’s hand, but he held them all
and showed no sign of pain.</p>

<p>Jones was mad and surprised, which made him
easy for the third double-shoot, and he, like the two
before him, struck out.</p>

<p>Not one of the three men had even fouled the ball.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” roared a spectator. “It seems that
you’ve got a pitcher there, after all!”</p>

<p>“Thanks, most astute sir,” chirped Ready, doffing
his cap and bowing. “He hasn’t begun to pitch
yet. He’s just getting warmed up.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX.<br>

<small>ONE TO NOTHING.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was the beginning of the ninth inning, and neither
side had scored. Never before had there been such
an exciting game in the city of Denver. The crowd
was throbbing, and Merriwell’s team had won a host
of friends by its clever work. Since the second inning,
however, Frank had given his men no chance to show
what they could do, for he had struck out man after
man, just as fast as they came up. Never in all his
life had he been in better form, and his work was
something to amaze his most intimate friends.</p>

<p>Bart Hodge, with his arm paining him from the
tip of his fingers to the shoulder, looked very well
satisfied.</p>

<p>Dick Merriwell was wild with delight and admiration.
He heard the crowd wondering at the work
of Frank and cheering at it, and it warmed his heart
toward the brother he had once thought he hated.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe!” he panted, “did you ever see anything
like it?”</p>

<p>“Ugh! No see before,” answered Crowfoot, still
smoking.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it fine?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>“Heap big noise. Ev’rybody yell lot; nobody get
killed yet.”</p>

<p>Three times had Merriwell’s men reached third,
but, by sharp work, the home team had kept them
from scoring. Now, however, Morley was desperate,
and he went among the men, urging them to win the
game.</p>

<p>“You must win it!” he said. “Elrich loses five
thousand and five hundred dollars if you don’t. He
won’t back the team another day. We’ll have to disband.”</p>

<p>“We’d win if we could hit that devil in the box,”
said Mahoney bitterly. “He’s the worst man we
ever went up against, and we all know it now. You’ll
never hear me tell anybody after this that there is no
such thing as a double-shoot. Why, that fellow can
throw regular corkscrew curves!”</p>

<p>Morley swore.</p>

<p>“You’re quitting!” he growled.</p>

<p>“Did you ever know me to quit?” asked Mahoney
angrily.</p>

<p>“No, but——”</p>

<p>“Then don’t talk! They have not scored, and we
may be able to make this a draw game, if we can’t
get in a run.”</p>

<p>Black Elrich was worried, although his face looked
perfectly calm, with the strained expression of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
gambler who is unchangeable before victory or defeat.
At his side, Dan Mahoney was seething.</p>

<p>“Hang it!” he grated. “If it had only been that
catcher’s right hand! The woman made a terrible
blunder!”</p>

<p>“No one would have thought him able to catch,
anyhow,” said Elrich.</p>

<p>“The big mitt protects his hand.”</p>

<p>“Still, it must hurt him every time the ball strikes,
for Merriwell has been using all kinds of speed.”</p>

<p>Morley came up to the place where he knew Elrich
was sitting.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” he asked, in a low tone.
“The boys can’t hit Merriwell, and it’s too late to try
to buy Harris, the umpire, now. Can’t you start a
riot and break up the game?”</p>

<p>“If you start it, it is worth a hundred dollars to
you,” said Elrich, “even though that will throw all
bets off, and I’ll make nothing. What say?”</p>

<p>“I can’t!” muttered Morley. “If I did so, Harris
would give the game to the other side, and you’d
lose just the same. If the spectators start it, it will
be all right.”</p>

<p>“The spectators won’t,” said the gambler. “More
than three-fourths of them are Merriwell men now.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Morley, “I am afraid for the result.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>Well might he be afraid. In the last inning Frank
was just as effective as ever, and the batters fell before
him in a way that was perfectly heart-breaking
to the admirers of the home team. Denver was unable
to score in the ninth.</p>

<p>“We must shut them out again, boys,” said Mahoney,
as his men took the field.</p>

<p>But Merriwell’s team went after that game in their
half of the ninth. Carker was the first man up. He
had not been hitting, and Park considered him easy.
That was when Park made a mistake, for Greg set
his teeth and laced out the first ball in a most terrific
manner.</p>

<p>It was a clean two-bagger. But Carker tried to
make it three, encouraged by Ready on the coaching-line.
Ready believed in taking desperate chances to
score, and he waved for Greg to come on.</p>

<p>The crowd was standing again, shouting wildly as
Carker tore across second and started on a mad sprint
to third.</p>

<p>The center-fielder got the ball and threw it to Mahoney
at second. Mahoney whirled and shot it to
third.</p>

<p>“Slide!” shrieked Ready.</p>

<p>Greg heard the command and obeyed, but Croaker
took the ball and touched him easily.</p>

<p>“Runner out!” decided the umpire clearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>Then there was another roar from the bleachers.</p>

<p>Jack Ready fiercely doubled his fist and thumped
himself behind the ear.</p>

<p>“All my fault!” he moaned. “I did it!”</p>

<p>Carker looked sorrowful.</p>

<p>“My last game of baseball,” he said sadly. “I do
not care to play the game any more. It is a deception
and a humiliation. No more! No more!”</p>

<p>Merriwell was the next batter. Park knew Merry
was a good hitter, and he was cautious. Frank did
his best to work the pitcher for a base on balls, but,
with two strikes called on him, he was finally forced
to hit.</p>

<p>He did so sharply, sending the ball shooting along
the ground between third and short.</p>

<p>Frank crossed first and turned to the left, knowing
it was best to have all the start he could if there was
any show of making second.</p>

<p>“Go on!” roared Browning, who had reached the
coaching-line at first, Ready, having come in from
near third.</p>

<p>Then Frank ran at his best speed. He knew it
would be close, and he flung himself forward for a
slide at second, which enabled him to reach the base
safely a moment ahead of the ball. By fast running,
he had made a two-bagger out of an ordinary single.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>Everybody knew now that Merriwell’s team was
out for the game in that inning if there was any possible
way to capture it. Such work turned the fans
into howling maniacs.</p>

<p>For once in his life, Jack Ready looked grave when
he took his place to strike. He realized the responsibility
on him, and it had driven the smile from his
ruddy face.</p>

<p>Park was pitching at his best, and he did not let up
a bit. Ready made two fouls, after which he put up
a high infield fly, which dropped and remained in the
hands of Croaker. Two men were out, and the admirers
of the home team began to breathe easier.</p>

<p>Merriwell was taking all the start he could get from
second when Carson got ready to hit.</p>

<p>Park seemed to feel absolutely sure of retiring the
side without further trouble, and he did get two
strikes on Berlin. Then something happened, for
the cattleman’s son did a thing to delight the heart of
his father. He made a beautiful safe hit to right
field and won the game.</p>

<p>Merriwell was running when the ball and bat met.
He knew it was not a high fly, and instinct told him
the fielder could not catch it. As he came toward
third, Hodge was on the coaching-line, madly motioning
for him to go in.</p>

<p>Frank obeyed. The fielder threw from right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
cut him off at the plate, but, by another splendid slide,
he scored.</p>

<p>The game was over.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the newspaper accounts of the game the following
day Merriwell’s team was highly praised, and
the reporters took pains to mention that it was the
hit of Berlin Carson, a Colorado lad, that brought in
the winning run.</p>
